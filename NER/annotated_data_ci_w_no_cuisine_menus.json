(apparently in my head.oops.) i'm sad i haven't talked about this place sooner as this place is a homey turkish cafe in its purest form. the food will speak for itself, and the portions are quite large and will leave you with energy to go on for days. it's a casual, cozy place with lovely outdoor seating in the warm months. when i went i got to sit on the cute plant filled patio and enjoy my kofte sandwich in sheer peaceful bliss (i legitimately had my only set in stone plan that day to eat there and my mouth still waters thinking of that sandwich). it's truly a gem, with service that i'd best call laid back (but still very attentive!). it's easy to take for granted a cute looking place that transit often passes by but this is not a location to tuck into your say you'll go every time you see it but never do because trust me you're missing out.",

    "my bud and i dined at cafe orchid recently, as we both had a hankering for some mediterranean food. cafe orchid has a small free parking lot adjacent to its location on addison, at a junction near lincoln and ravenswood (they have a second location in suburban park ridge). there is an enclosed porch as a dining area, though everyone on this evening was in the main dining room (take a step up when you walk in to this space). one corner of the folksy looking interior seemed to be a couples area this particular evening, so we chose to sit next to this family instead. we received a basket of turkish style bread, a type of bread that i have grown to enjoy over the years in turkish restaurants in chicago as well as in turkey. we ordered the mujver for appetizer. these are three zucchini pancakes that are fried and look almost like egg foo young patties. there is some feta cheese inside as well, and the cup of yogurt sauce is a good dipping sauce for these crunchy patties. they have some entrees that are marked as highly recommended turkish specialties. i ordered the hunkar begendi (sultan delight), with a generous pile of cubed lamb pieces sitting atop a bed of grilled eggplant puree. there are also pieces of pepper in the mix. i generally love eggplant, but this eggplant puree had a curiously gooey texture that did not quite sit well with me though that may just be the inherent nature of this style of serving eggplant. you get a side of white rice or bulgur i chose the bulgur and my bud went with the rice, and i'd say both went very well with our respective meals. my bud ordered the chicken with okra entree, a stew like dish with garbanzo beans, tomato, garlic and red pepper. while my bud cleaned up his plates ravenously, i had a second go of my meal as leftovers the day after. we both enjoyed baklava for dessert. each serving consists of four small sweet but not too sweet rectangles, and they tasted just right. we liked our dinner at cafe orchid, though i'd say i prefer a couple of other turkish / mediterranean restaurants in chicago a bit more.",

    "i have lived near this place for the 8 years i have lived in chicago and have never been to it. what a mistake! it is exactly the kind of place you want to discover. it is one of those neighborhood restaurants that feels like a gem uncovered the moment you walk in. it was mostly groups of people and it felt like everyone was just meeting up in their home for a nice gathering. honestly, it does feel like a home. gas stove in the corner, quaint, very warm, and also what i think was a stereo system on some wood shelves in the corner, next to one of the tables. my husband and i decided to finally try this place while my parents are in town visiting. my parents love all the different foods chicago has to offer and this place just solidified their amazement in this city. finding a restaurant like this is very unique. they are world travelers in this is the sort of thing they live for! an example of how unique this place is, the women at the table next to us who apparently have tried almost everything on the menu (great hint that it's the neighborhood gem!) had been to syria and turkey, both of which my parents visited as well. i can't tell you the last time i met people around here that travel to these types of places! very cool. anyway, they were very helpful with what to order; basically you can't go wrong with anything. the gentleman with them said their sea bass is out of this world but it is now a special so you have to call ahead to see if it will be there. we were there for the lamb this time, though. food: my mom and i both had lamb, mine was in the iskender. very flavorful and most importantly to us, tender. not gamey thankfully, but only a few bits of gristle. the iskender was a bit different than i expected, the fried bread was actually mixed in with it. almost like big croutons but made with their phenomenal bread. just can't get it too soaked up with the yogurt to keep the texture ok. my one critique is that i felt like it needed rice with it, or flatbread, or some of the sauces; all of which came with all the other dishes. husband got the mixed plate so he was able to try all the meats. he didn't talk the whole time so that means he was too busy inhaling it because he really liked it. my dad wanted to order about 7 dishes so he liked his but didn't feel complete. so many great dishes to choose from. the bread we started out with, which i'm unsure whether it came with the baba ganoush or came complimentary, was truly phenomenal. my mom isn't supposed to have gluten but had to eat some. it was irresistible. the inside was so doughy with a nice crispy outside. and the baba ganoush was the best my parents have ever had outside of turkey. the smokiness was so powerful and really added complexity to the dip. delicious! byob is a huge plus. what value this place is! we all had so much food and for what an amazing price tag! my husband and i will be taking our 8 year old stepson back soon to try it because we know even he will love it. can't wait.",

    "we live super close to this restaurant and have heard good things and finally made it over for a weekday dinner. we got there fairly early, 6pm, and only a few other tables were filled. the server was very nice and we had our 4 yr old twins with us and he was friendly towards them. it is a quiet place so i was a bit worried about them being too loud but they were great and behaved well and no one was bothered. we started with the mujver (zucchini pancake) and it was very good. the sauce it came with seemed completely flavorless, but we asked for another sauce and he very nicely brought out the spicy red sauce and the white sauce (like a tzaziki?). very crispy, flavorful, we enjoyed them. i like that it came on a bed of lettuce because our kids ate that! they also liked the bread. i had the beef kebabs with white rice and although the beef was a little overcooked, the flavor was great and i loved the rice with chickpeas. the side salad was also simply dressed and flavorful. overall i was happy with mine (but next time might ask if they can cook them more to medium temp). my husband got the mixed kebabs with lamb, gyros, chicken and i had one bite of the lamb and while i'm not the biggest lamb person, i felt that it didn't have much flavor. he disagreed and liked it so that's what counts. the small bite of gyros i had was good. i am looking forward to my leftovers for lunch! we will be back, they were friendly and it's a good neighborhood place. we'll try a few other things next time. love that it's byob.",

    "have passed by cafe orchid for a few years, and on xmas day, we finally took the plunge. late afternoon lunch (like 3:00pm) before going to a matinee. you just needed something to tide you over until you do the first of many makeover dinners from the last night's xmas spread. the bright afternoon sun reflected off the mirror tile wall. ugh! those mirror tiles were so badly streaked. made you kind of think the whole place was sleazy. not a great first impression. so rather than being too adventurous, we opted for the benchmark middle eastern appetizers. lentil soup, and falafel. the soup was a flavorless yellow/beige color flecked with a lovely swirl of harissa oil. the red oil was a nice garnish, but didn't do much for the flavor. to make it semi palatable, we closed our eyes, added ample amounts of table salt and pepper, squeezed the juice of lemon wedge served alongside, and pretended we were in mykonos eating avgolemono soup. falafel's origin is most likely of egyptian/ red sea bordering countries, but it is seen in turkey. cafe orchid's version was not best rendition i've ever tasted. the extremely dense chickpea mixture was dry on the inside, almost crumbly. however, the dill dipping sauce served alongside was tasty, as was the tahini based sauce. high point of this dining experience, the freshly baked bread/pita, dipped in the sauces meant to accompany the falafel. we got an extra basket, and filled ourselves up with it. we left most of the falafel . not really impressed with cafe o.",

    "stopped by here after a conference in the area and ordered the hot appetizer sampler with a friend (comes with 1 kibbe, about 6 falafel, 2 pieces of sigara boregi, cut in half, calamari, and a lemon wedge (around 15.95). kibbe was tiny and only 1 piece, minimal filling, falafels were tough and while the flavor was there, it just wasn't up to par with other falafel places. calamari was slightly tough, but if you must, get the sigara boregi. the right amount of feta cheese with the herbs and crunch of the phyllo dough is the redeeming part of this platter. ayran was just ok. outside, they have a nice patio and free parking next to the athletico in the lot. overall, not a place where i'd go out of my way and make a trip.",

    "excellent place for turkish food in chicago. casual and inviting restaurant right off the addison brown line. it is byob as well and there is a trader joe's down lincoln avenue. went on a saturday for lunch with a friend and sat in their covered patio area. our waiter was attentive and immediately brought out waters and opened the bottle of wine i had. we started with a plate of hummus, ezme, and a shepherd's salad (tomato, cucumber, and red onion tossed in oil and vinegar). a basket of bread came out as well and went well with the hummus and ezme. for my main, i ordered the kofte (lamb) kebab with rice. it was served with a side salad and came out with yogurt sauce and hot sauce. it was great! the meat was juicy and flavorful. i was pretty full from the appetizers so i ended up eating half of the plate and took the rest home. the prices are great as well and overall it is a nice little place to enjoy lunch or dinner. i will keep coming because of this!",

    "i ordered the fried livers and the okra with olive oil. they were both insanely good. i used amazon delivery. the crunchiness of the livers didn't quite hold up en route, but the flavor was out of this world! besides, most fried items don't travel well so i knew what was up. the okra wasn't what i was expecting, being a stew. this was an umami bomb! the flavor was amazing, and the okra was beautifully cooked. they kinda seemed like little tortellinis, exploding with flavor as they were bitten. the bread that came with the order was also amazing, making a perfect vehicle for the okra broth and the leftover crumbly bits of the liver! overall i'm super happy with my order. my only piece of advice is to be more descriptive on the online menus, but i'm totally nitpicking. i should mention that my 4 year old daughter inhaled the livers and the okra, and she's going through a picky food phase. she almost cried when the food was gone and asked me to order more! i'll definitely be back and i'm gonna try the livers in the restaurant, fresh out the fryer!",

    "chicago doesn't boast a lot of turkish restaurants. cafe orchid's location doesn't make it stand out much. but the food does. the creamed eggplant and tomatoes with turkish bread, meat pies, and chicken shish kebab with rich were all a hit. i even finished with a kazindibi. i went early in the day and had an outdoor seat since it was warm. there is plenty of seating inside and spacious such that you're not crowded. the service was very good, but the food was where cafe orchid truly shines.",

    "i've been to istanbul and this is my favorite turkish meal by far! i came on a saturday night with my family. we were visiting from out of town. we started our meal with appetizers. we ordered the hummus which was wonderfully garlicky followed by the roasted peppers , the kibbe, and fried livers. we contemplated stopping the meal there, since we full. however, y o l o. no regrets. we proceeded to order sultan platter with beef, lamb shank, sultan with chicken, iskander with lamb, and uskudar. we loved it all. so much so we got the meat sweats. or it could have been the fact that we were seated right next to the outdoor heater. either way, the service was amazing, the food was amazing, this was the best way to kick off a saturday night. we did bring their own bottles of wine, which they opened for us.",

    "quaint little restaurant on a random triangular corner with a small, convenient parking lot. i've visited on two separate occasions over a span of months and neither times disappointed. for appetizers, we had the veggie pide and kibbe the pide is only served on weekends as it takes longer to prepare and cook. it is homemade dough with peppers, mozzarella cheese, zucchini, and tomatoes. the dough is soft and chewy while the flavors are slightly similar to pizza except there is no tomato paste. the kibbe resembles a fried dumpling but is stuffed with ground beef and onions. both were very good choices. for entrees, we had the iskenderw ith lamb, lamb shank, vegetable stew, and baked eggplant. we're obviously huge fans of lamb and vegetable. the iskender came in a platter that was evenly divided by lamb cubes and a thick yogurt sauce. there were also cubes of pan fried bread that did a swell job of soaking up the lamb essence. the flavors are quite bold with this one. the lamb shank was particularly juicy and tender in which the meat easily came off the bone. the vegetable stew consisted of baked eggplant, zucchini, carrot, potatoes, mushroom, green beans, okra, green and red peppers, onions, and tomatoes. it was definitely a mix of everything which is great considering how we had so much meat and carbs with the other items on the table. the baked eggplant resembled a lasagna in which there were layers of tomatoes, onion, green and red peppers, parsely, and pine nut. by the end of all that, we did not have any room left for dessert.",

    "an affordable and authentic traditional turkish restaurant! the waiting service was stellar as when we weren't particularly satisfied with the fried liver, they returned with a fresh dish which were 10 folds better. i especially love their complimentary warm basket of pide bread. cafe orchid located just east of the addison brown line makes it ultra easy to get to. the line up of our dinner was extravagant to say the least: (1) babaganoush. grilled eggplant puree with tahini, fresh lemon juice, garlic and olive oil for a silky smooth consistency similar to texture of oatmeal. very addictive, especially paired with their freshly baked bread. (2) arnavut cigeri. fried beef liver cut into cubes mixed with potato fries and a large side of onions, lemon zest and paprika. trying this dish was quite the brave stride towards tasting authentic turkish cuisine, but that's what i'm all about trying new exotic things. (3) hunkar begendi. sultan delight. eggplant puree sauteed in mozzarella cheese with lamb, onions, bell peppers, olive oil and bulgar. a turkish twist along the same vein of hummus and polenta, a cheesy eggplant paste served with a plate of grains. pairs well with practically any thing from bulgar, rice to bread. (4) kebab combo. wow, completely mind blown by the generous platter of assorted turkish meats, salad and white rice. this can feed a family. my favorite was the beef and gyro with tahini sauce.",

    "decided to try this place on a friday afternoon because we heard good things about the food and also saw them on check please. we arrived at around 6pm and were seated on the outdoor patio. i was disappointed with the decor of the patio. it felt run down and honestly a bit dirty. i then made the mistake of using the bathroom before ordering and i was absolutely disgusted. the toilet was extremely dirty and not acceptable at all for a dining establishment. i was ready to leave the restaurant after visiting the bathroom but the bottle of wine we brought was already opened so we decided to stay. we ordered hummus, the gyros ka bob, and another dish but i honestly can not give an honest review of the food because i was still disgusted from the dirty bathroom and lost my appetite. as they say a bathroom is much easier to clean than a kitchen, so i can only imagine how dirty that must be. i will not be returning. the place really needs some cleaning up.",

    "good appetizers. service was kind of sub par. not much seating here because it's basically the first floor of a house converted into a restaurant with half of it being the kitchen. they have an outdoor patio seating area that is enclosed and can be dined at, it's well insulated. ordered drinks and took forever for them to arrive. the zucchini pancakes were not worth it, 7.95 for 3 cakes and they definitely have fillers. also not very good, super greasy and burnt. came with yogurt sauce and some parsley mixed into the sauce. the white beans salad was great, also 7.95, but i could easily make it at home. regardless, it was a large size. then we also got the meat pies, they really are meat dumplings. they were good but for 8 4 pieces, super thin, also seems a bit of a rip off. also came with yogurt sauce. lastly we got the fried liver, it says on the menu best fried liver in chicago. they were nice, the liver were well breaded, came with shredded pieces of french fries. also came with an onion and tomato salad on the side. however, if eating liver is not something you do often, you may find the taste of liver offensive. the restaurant was busy, that probably explains why the service was lacking. my water was only refilled once during my entire meal. however, for what it's worth, i'd definitely come back. they have a lot of different varieties. not to mention it's easy to find parking, they have parking in the front of the restaurant and on the side of the street because there is a metra stop right by it. they also offer takeout and delivery.",

    "honest review: omg the food is so good! so flavorful! so much better then sultans market! the only issues is the ambiance isnt the prettiest. its kind of ur whole in the wall restaurant. i wouldnt bring a date here because its not a cute date spot. i didnt like the service at all he couldnt give any recommendations n he kept talkin on his phone really annoying and he messed up our order besides those two negatives the food is great! turkish food is exactly like greek so if u love greek food youll love this place. the best things were the zucchini pancakes, fried river, iskender n the kebab combo mix im coming back here again! 7.95 fried liver: i hate liver i really do but this was phenomenal. they were perfectly fried supper tender not dry not greasy at all. the liver was so flavorful not bland at all. then theres these lil fries that add another crunch element to the dish. the onion salad was amaizin! it cut through the richness of the liver. then the lemon added a nice note of acidity this is a must order if u love liver n if u dont this will turn u into a lover 6.50 falafel: best falafel i ever had because it was so flavorful. i never them with so much seasoning in them. then there is a delish salad on the side i love mediterranean food cause theirs always a salad on the side. the falafel is so crunchy and not greasy at all. it comes with two sauces. i didnt like the tahini sauce the other one is delish the perfect dipping sauce 6 come in an order 7.95 zucchini pancake: omg so good! i would just come back for these! their so rich i never thought vegetables could taste so good. their really big n not greasy! these are tje best fritters i ever had their so good! theirs feta cheese in it that adds a nice rich creamy salty flavor! the dippin sauce is really rich and pairs perfectly with the fritter. 21.95 kebab mix combo: omg if u love kababs u will love this! my least favorite was the gyro meat. not saying that it was grows it was just meh every other thing on the dish was way more flavorful. however, it was tender and not ur typical frozen nasty gyro meat that u get at chicago stands. the chicken was amaizing! supper tender and so flavorful i couldnt stop eating it. i was really surprised on how good it was! there is this really long sausage idk what it was called but it was phenomenal it was the best thing of the meal it was so tender! the other sausage patty was really delish! the pita was really flavorful n their homemade! the sauce was really good really fresh iskender: omg this was phenomenal. the sauce is so rich and so full of flavor. then theres so much lamb in it n there really flavorful and tender! theres pieces of bread in it that really makes it a knock out the cream sauce cuts through the richness order this dish get it with the lamb though not the gyro meat i didnt like it",

(if you like the desserts, try elshafei sweets in palos hills. it isn't a sit down, but it blows this place out of the water, as it does most places, especially greek and turkish bakeries, no offense, i'm sure the home made stuff is good.) if i came again, i would try different dishes, but to be honest, i probably wouldn't come again.",

    "any day i get to shove a dozen charred shrimp in my face is a great day. when said shrimp are served on giant decorative skewers that, like all worthwhile kitchen tools, can be used to both slaughter and tastefully present one's prey, it's a day of ultimate perfection. add a basket of homemade bread, a garlicky tabouleh salad, tender chicken kebabs and tangy yogurt sauce, and you earn yourself a 4 star yelp review! would give 5 were it not for the atmosphere is that indoor/outdoor tent addition even legal? however, the location one block from my kung fu school, where my most savage post workout cravings are unleashed and the fresh, flavorful, delicious food is more than enough to keep me coming back.",

    "i hadn't been here in six or so years, but couldn't remember why. i figured it out its that my body doesn't really agree with the absolutely delicious traditional turkish food, but i digress. the ambience is interesting the older part of the restaurant is quaint and cute. the newer part is more tent like. bathrooms are clean :) each menu item is full of flavor and well made. we sampled everything from the bread and lentil soup (make sure to squeeze the lemon in), to kibbe, the the baked eggplant, iskander with doner, and baklava. all excellent in flavor, many stuffed with garlic and amazing spices. it's also byob = bonus!",

    "on a mission to try chicago's ethnic eateries that fly under the radar, a friend and i did dinner at cafe orchid. although i was glad to try turkish food for the first time, i wasn't wowed enough for a repeat visit. to my untrained palate, turkish food seems similar to greek food. (the menu included hummus, dolma, musakka, gyro, baclava and other familiar favorites.) according to rudimentary research, turkish food tends to be a little more flavorful, seasoned with warm allspice or bay leaves and seasoned with a heavier hand. you'll often see yogurt on the side. more than anything, i remember my meal as oily. to be a little healthier, i ordered the sahanda kebab, lamb meatballs (kofte) sauteed with red and green pepper, tomato and potato; although i liked the flavor, the entire dish was blanketed in a thin layer of shining olive oil. (i preferred my leftovers, because after refrigerating overnight, i could skim some of the excess oil from the top.) the service was a little spotty a new waitress at every turn. on the bright side, i would recommend our dessert to anyone with a sweet tooth. at the waitress' suggestion, my friend and i split kunefe, a bufala cheese stuffed phyllo pastry soaked in honey. perfect with dark turkish coffee on the side! byob.",

    "my wife, son and i love cafe orchid. we often start with one or two apps. we usually choose from the hummus, baba, dolmas and falafil. they are all excellent and you can not go wrong with any of these apps. my son absolutely loves the lamb kebabs and this is one of his favorite restaurants. my wife has most recently tried the ala turca, which is chicken breast stuffed with spinach in a tasty tomato sauce. she ordered the dish with the bulgur which we tend to order. it is better than the rice and is hard to find as not many restaurants seem to have bulgur. i tend to order the adana kebabs which is similar to kofte (essentially turkish meatloaf), but instead of using ground lamb, adana is made with chopped lamb. the seasoning in the adana is great. it comes with bulgur (or rice) and a salad. we have also had the sultan delight and uskudar. although they are traditional dishes and are both fine, i pretty much just go straight for the adana or lamb kebabs each time. overall we have probably dined at cafe orchid 10 15 times and i think we were only disappointed one time (the lamb kebabs were over cooked). the service is perfect for us as they tend to check in 2 3 times during the course of the evening always in a passive/relaxed manner. so many servers seem to either forget you still exist after the food is brought to the table or, worse, stop by and ask how the food tastes every 6 minutes. the servers seem to have found a nearly perfect balance of attending to your needs without being an annoying pain in the backside. and, of course, cafe orchid is byob. always a plus. in addition, while the weather is nice, we like to eat outside. the seating is on addison and not far from the street, but it adds an element of energy and city living that we enjoy.",

    "yesterday, me and my wife chose to go to the cafe orchid looking at the reviews. i have to say 4 star given to this place's food is exaggerated! the location is very convinient, the place and staff was warm and welcoming but the food was terrible. we ordered eggplant musakka, iskender, manti and adana kebab. i know how a turkish food should taste. besides i cook almost all of the dishes listed in the menu at home! eggplant musakka was very good if it was less salty. it took us a long time to have the musakka gone although we die for it. the yogurt used in manti and iskender was a cheap store bought variety and was diluted with water. i would expect them to make their own yogurt or at least buy greek yogurt like chobani! manti was overcooked. the meat was almost out of the dough! a good manti must be cooked little more than al dente. also they used too much cumin in the tomato sauce. gyro meat tasted good although it was not a pure beef leaves. but how it was cut was a no no. if you go to turkey you should have seen how cooks treat this delicious gyro meat: cut as thin as a paper. mine was like a chucks of ground beef. as to the sauce, again so much cumin and salt! adana kebab was the best of all. the spiciness and how it was cooked was great. but the rice came with it was so dry and tasteless. they should learn how to cook basmati rice. the salad was no where close to a real turkish salad! at the end we asked for tea, expecting this would be good. but again they served us tea which was so strong and was not made with authentic turkish tea leaves! bottom line, there are better places to have turkish food in chicago.",

    "after returning from a 10 day trip to turkey, i needed a turkish food fix, fast, and cafe orchid seemed the most promising. my favorite thing to eat in turkey was manti (turkish ravioli) so i was relieved to see cafe orchid offered it (and they have a vegetarian version too!) the manti, while tasty, are way bigger than authentic manti. manti in turkey are tiny almost like spaetzle. these were like tortellini. but very tasty. i'd get it again. husband got some kind of kabob, maybe kofte? he was happy with it. we also tried the icli kofte and they were pretty tasty (tasted like what we ate on our trip). the only thing that was actually not good that we ended up tossing was the mucver zucchini pancakes. these were really gross. huge and so greasy. like a big greasy sponge. i think they just hadn't been fried in hot enough oil. they were oozing oil even in the box, and we each tried a bite and just couldn't stomach them. i was sad because they're usually great. maybe this was a one time thing but i wouldn't try them again from here. for the most part, the food was pretty good. nice to have an authentic turkish place nearby!",

    "my husband and i stopped by cafe orchid on a whim one thursday evening and were more than pleased with our dinner experience! when we arrived at the restaurant, we were disappointed to find no parking in the lot; however there were numerous quick spots to the left of the restaurant; great, problem solved! we get seated quickly in the indoor/outdoor makeshift portion of the restaurant. it wasn't fancy date worthy, but definitely a fine ambience for thursday evening. we received warm turkish break with olive oil and butter. we had the sigara borek as the appetizer and it was delicious! it was just how i remember it as a child. this is a crispy cigar shaped phyllo dough and cheese vehicle of deliciousness. in addition to this, i ordered the iskender and my husband ordered the manti. these were both the most authentic turkish food that i have had outside of turkey! the iskender was very filling and both had an option of tomato or butter sauce. the icing on the cake came when we asked for the check, and our wonderful turkish waitress apologized for any wait we experienced and gave us the most delicious baklavah. we were in heaven. this baklavah wasn't too syrup y or dry, it was perfect. she was so polite and apologetic, despite the fact that everything came out on time! we appreciated her making that extra effort! we will definitely be back!",

    "cafe orchid is an awesome turkish restaurant that is easy to miss, nestled in the corner of lincoln and addison by the el. everything i've tried here is great: kabobs, shawarma, falafel which is some of the best in the city. my personal favorite is the kefta kabob, probably the best kefta i've had ground meat mixed with spices and onions for a wonderful tender explosion of flavor. it comes with bulgur or basmati rice, but i prefer the bulgur, a grain that is amazingly seasoned here, rich and a bit greasy, that blends with the meat so well. really good food, and the (presumably turkish) waitresses are pretty smokin', which doesn't hurt either. i'd like to bang a turkish woman. they are really sexy, with their sultry almond skin and exotic, smoke filled, arabian mystique. but i digress. the point is, come here with friends and a bottle of wine and enjoy the pleasant ambiance and delicious food while you fantasize about your steamy encounter with a beautiful turkish woman, hear your friends' laughter dimly in the background while you smile distantly, feeling warm but far away due to the wine, your thoughts really focused on your night of passion, this mysterious creature shifting in and out of layers of flowing fabric as she dances sensually around you, your drunken reverie exploding into a passionate exploration of untold lands, united in a state of foreign and illicit bliss, until you are brought back to reality by the somber stacking of chairs behind you and the check being passed around the table, because you were too shy to say anything, even though you swear she smiled only at you when you walked in. there's no point, she's out of your league, and it could never be as good as your fantasy anyway. at least that's what you tell yourself, to justify your inaction, the never ending stream of empty booze filled nights and broken dreams. so go home and drink another bottle of jack, and wake up tomorrow for another day of good food, wine, friends, and the promise of something your fantasy, your princess, who will carry you away to a world of adventure and endless possibility. and make sure you stop by cafe orchid in the meantime!",

    "we came here after a cub game. yes, we were sober. it was a cubs/cardinals game, and, as it turns out, it was the cub game with highest attendance of the season. lucky us. love crowds. who doesn't? meanwhile, let me go off on a tangent for a moment: we sat next to cards fans, and, to add to the fun, about 97 percent of the crowd was wearing red. thus, the cubs lost, as is expected in these circumstances. i had high hopes, but my north side nine let me down, like bad boyfriends. you love them, and they crush your soul. so it goes. to add insult to injury, i missed the ernie banks plastic statue giveaway by minutes. my cards fan neighbor got one, having entered the field 75 seconds before i did, and offered it to my husband for 20 bucks. (really?) he wanted to buy a wrigley field t shirt across the street, on his way back to peoria, and the gist of this deal was that he could not afford that piece of cloth otherwise. apparently, 20 bucks (for free plastic ernie) stood between him (and us) and the ridiculously overpriced t shirt. here's the thing. if i happened to find myself at busch stadium, and was handed, say, an albert pujols plastic thing, 1. aside from plastic albert, i could probably afford a stupid, overpriced t shirt; having had enough money to travel a good distance (gas, food, time off work, etc.) to get there, and 2. i'd give the damned thing to a fan, regardless of my situation. (give. meaning 'for free.') anyway. so cubs lost, which to a cub fan, is neither here nor there. once free of the field, we wandered down addison, having avoided cubby bear, sluggers, blah blah tool frat fool bar.only to find cafe orchid. it's byob, as a friendly waitress/greeter told us, so we headed down lincoln toward a liquor store. because at this point, life without liquor seemed bleak. by the way, (as my story becomes increasingly tangential) this area looks like it's seen better days. funny how that happens. give it a block, and the real estate prices would soar, and the hipsters would probably open coffee shops and/or distilleries, and sniff at your lower class lower classiness. and so it goes. anyway, we found one. (not a hipster. a liquor store.) to my delight, a sign on the door said, no cell phones. they are insolent and vexing. how i love thee. meanwhile, the woman behind the counter scowled at us can't blame her, given the long gone, last chance, mad max block she worked in but once we settled on our libation and appeared able to pay (again, can't blame her) she softened. and smiled. so we ambled back to orchid. you're waiting for my review, aren't you? .and you are saying, jesus, woman! make your point! ok, here it is. i love this place. first, soft lighting, sit where you want. then, would you like some ice for your byob? then, would you like appetizers? then.here's the then.they don't rush you. if you want to hang out and work your way through your byob, so be it. want to linger over your appetizer? go right <a href=/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fahead.careands=3a4c5315ed766e443ecd0448765fb2d80be92fcfae55ce4e7d62a73de9dfde83 target=_blank rel=nofollow>ahead.care</a> to stare at other tables for a bit? you got it. they don't push. (but, hey, don't take advantage of their kindness. they might need the table, so be cool.) and then, the food. it was all so good. the spinach pie, the feta plate, the kibbeh, the iskendar, the mantar sote.oh, and the turkish coffee may be the best we've ever had this side of istanbul. the staff is kind, courteous, knowledgeable, and efficient. long story short, if you did not read all the way through my wacky review (and who would, beyond the heartiest souls?) skip to this: eat here. you will like it. that is all.",

    "it took me a long time to get back to cafe orchid. i am going to bump them to 3.5 stars based on the food, but the service still needs some work, at least up front. after we sat down, the wait and bus staff were great. but upon entering, a gruff woman serving as hostess (but later waiting tables), inquired whether we had a reservation. upon finding out that we did not, she sort of exasperatedly cast about the patio area and then brusquely indicated a two top for us to occupy. i really hate it when places make walk in parties feel like a burden compared to reservation parties. two aspects of this really chapped my hide in this case: 1.) when we came in at 6:30, only half a dozen tables in the entire place were occupied; then, when we left at 7:30, about two thirds of them were. clearly they were not lacking for space. and 2.) we were not offered a choice of indoors or outdoors. i strongly preferred to sit inside, but instead we enjoyed the hot patio, where the westering sun shone directly into my left eyeball for twenty straight minutes. it didn't dispose me positively towards the meal. thank heavens that the food was great. my wife and i split a nice babaganoush served with their excellent house bread. i stole a few bites of her ala turca entree (chicken breast stuffed with spinach and cheese), which was tasty but no match for mine, the sahanda kebab. it was just pieces of chicken cooked with green and red peppers and a tomato sauce, but sometimes simplicity can be brilliant. i would definitely order that dish again. it was all filling, too: i took home at least half of my entree and rice. there are several other enticing house specialties that i'd like to try, so i think that we will be back. but a word of advice to cafe orchid: keep churning out great food and don't make your walk in business feel like second class citizens. you clearly are not that dependent upon reservations if your restaurant was one third empty at 7:30 on a saturday night.",

    "i came here on a saturday evening at 7. they have cute outdoor seating areas, which was our preference because it was a gorgeous chicago summer night, but when asked if we had a reservation (we didn't), the hostess seemed annoyed that we asked to sit outside. she put us in a tiny corner, handed us menus and then neglected to return for at least 10 minutes. we got bread about 15 minutes into the experience. service was definitely weak throughout the meal, except for the girl who kept refilling our water glasses.she was like a ninja sneaking up out of the shadows the instant your water glass got lower than half full! they also got a star for honoring my request for lemon and cucumber for my water. i had the chicken kabobs and asked to substitute hummus for the rice/bulgar option. not allowed. (i find that seriously annoying! hummus is just as cheap to make as rice/bulgar, so it doesn't cost that much more to substitute it, and i would've paid extra if she would've let me!) the waitress added extra salad, since i didn't want rice/bulgar. the salad (lettuce, tomato, red onion, vinaigrette) was bland and i only ate a few bites. it took up over half of my plate. there were about 6 or 7 cubes of chicken, which were cooked to perfection and delicious. they were served on top of half a pita, which did not appear (or taste) to be freshly made. for the price (around 14) it wasn't a great value or that tasty. overall the place is fine i guess, but there are much better options around the city, and for less money! i don't feel the need to eat here again.",

    "byob, awesome patio, great service, delicious food. really, what more do you want? shared a bunch of vegetarian dishes with a group of folks, one of the corner pieces was the vegetarian combination which is a mix of hot and cold appetizers. i didn't love everything on the plate but thought the ezme and the eggplant salad were the stand outs. also tried the vegetarian stew and the zucchini pancakes (favorite dish of the night). props to the waitress, who let us know when dishes might need a little extra something to be shared well (zucchini pancakes come 3 to an order, she recommended adding another because she wouldn't want to give someone half of her pancake). it's great that they do this (i've been to some places that won't) and even better that they provide fair warning. lots of other dishes i'd love to try and definitely a place i'd be interested in coming back to.",

    "we were visiting chicago for the weekend recently and being that my boyfriend is half turkish, we had to get some turkish food. while researching restaurant options, we came across cafe orchid and only saw good reviews. we got to the restaurant on a saturday evening (half hour before close), we were the only ones in the restaurant. we were greeted with, are you picking up an order? we said, we'd like to dine in for dinner, if you're still serving. we were quickly seated (in the attached porch) and since we had already looked at the menu online we were ready to order. it should be noted that it was a very cold night in chicago and the staff left the door from the porch to the actual restaurant closed because the temp in the porch was quite chilly (i'm assuming they didn't want to get cold), we didn't even take off our jackets nor hats, and i had to move my seat closer to the center of the room, away from the window because it was sooo cold! our food came within 15 minutes and we quickly scarfed it down as we could tell the staff was antsy to close (as they kept staring at us). suggestions for the restaurant's staff and manager: 1. stop accepting dine in customers at least an hour before closing time (so your customers won't feel rushed), 2. please get some space heaters and/or offer indoor seating when there is freezing temps outside, 3. please learn some basic customer service skills (i.e., don't stare at the guests, don't rush their experience, make them feel comfortable, etc.). the food was okay, however the coldness in the porch and rushed feeling put a complete damper on the entire experience. if we weren't visiting from out of town and staying at a hotel downtown, we would've probably taken our food to go. to conclude, we walked out of the restaurant at 10:58pm, we didn't want to take up any more of their time than necessary.",

(which is totally not the case) she also forgot to bring one of the dishes and brought it after everyone else is done and again no apology or anything.and about the coat,she took it saying she will wipe it and when she brought it,the huge stain was entirely there. we asked for manager to talk and she was like tell whatever you wanna say to me,no manager. luckily someone else called the manager and he was even ruder than the waitress. do yourself a favor and don't go to this place if you do not want to be behaved super disrespectfully.",

    "really great local find! came here on a friday evening after work, and shared some appetizers and wine with friends. byob! wahoo! great food we had the vegetarian sampler which came with warm flatbread. all really delicious! the sampler comes with a number of flavored hummus, falafel, and stuffed grape leaves. the dish included a spicy pepper relish which was out of this world! we also tried an order of the meat pies which were just okay. we split baklava and a custard for dessert. i'm texturally not a custard fan, but this had a delicious burnt cream layer that was really good. eager to go back and try some of the entrees. overall good ambiance; we sat out on the screened patio which was a nice quiet environment. staff was friendly and attentive, and prices were very reasonable! only downside is a table was seated next to us and they brought their dog in a kennel with them that yipped the entire meal! definitely will come back.",

    "i didn't write many specifics in my initial review, so here goes. the first time i went to cafe orchid, it was in the company of a number of turkish graduate students from northwestern. they declared in no uncertain terms that this was the best turkish food in the city and my experience that time and subsequently has confirmed this. the decor and ambiance are pretty basic, nothing fancy, but there's something charming about both the indoor and outdoor patio spaces. getting here is pretty easy, it's a block from the brown line and there's street parking in addition to their free parking lot. the servers are friendly and aim to please, but getting your food can be a little slow when it's busy. so what makes this a 5 star restaurant? byob + excellent food = great value. the restaurant is byob and they will happily open anything that you bring them. don't worry if you forgot to bring a bottle, evolution liquor on lincoln ave has a great selection of beers and wine, although make sure you check their hours. the food is excellent with large portions and great flavors. some personal favorites are the appetizer sampler which comes with a great variety of cold vegetarian appetizers, the lamb shank, and the kebabs in general and the mix combo entree in particular which has 4 different meats. the warm bread that comes with the meal is awesome, you'll want seconds.",

    "this is an awesome second date place for several reasons. 1. it's super cute both inside and out. you'll definitely score cool points for this find just on the appearance alone. 2. turkish cuisine demonstrates that you're open to trying new things without being so obscure that your date thinks you're weird. 3. it's really affordable so if both parties decide that they actually hate each other then you won't feel like you've thrown away a huge chunk of change for nothing. 4. it's byob so the price of getting that perfect buzz to go in for the kill isn't going break your bank either. 5. the food is fantastic. try the iskander, the uskudar, stuffed grape leaves, and amazing shepard salad. can't go wrong with any of these. 6. the staff is friendly, yet not over talkative. the perfect balance of pleasant conversation and get the fout of here. 7. there's a free parking lot so you don't have to deal with either parking or shady valet dudes. i'm not exactly an expert on second dates seeing as how i haven't been on very many, but for any occasion i'd say all this bits of information add up to a pretty solid experience no matter what the occasion.",

    "i frequently trust the yelp aggregate score, especially with a restaurant like this where 252 reviews are on the books. unfortunately, i beg to differ in this case. this was quite possibly the most disappointing meal my girlfriend and i confronted in the last three years. i speculate that on the night we ate, the cook called in sick and the employees were on food preparation duty, which probably ticked them off. atmosphere: we were the only two at the establishment on a monday night. the servers, who appeared quite bitter throughout the night, sat in the server area, watching us eat our entire meal. incredibly uncomfortable. we thought we had showed up right before they were closing, but a quite check on the cell phone showed they were seating until 10pm. so why the attitude? i asked my server what was different between adana and kofte and he had the nerve to grab my menu, turn the page to the index, and coldly suggest that i read the descriptions. it was almost enough for me to stand up and walk out right then and there. the servers continued to watch us throughout the night, so my girlfriend and i had to whisper about how bizarre and awkward the whole situation was. food quality: terrible. disgusting, even. my kofte (ground lamb, thx guyz!) was rare as can be. it sat on a bed of croutons drenched in oil (mild spicy butter sauce.hahahhahaha). the yogurt was straight out of the bottle and ran like a white river. my girlfriend's falafel was even worse. it seemed as though the falafels were frozen, and the cook simply dropped them into hot oil, burnt the outside, but the heat did not penetrate to the middle. in other words, the middle of the falafels was completely uncooked, and the outside was burnt. she was spared the bed of oil drenched croutons and instead received a pretty good onion and tomato salad. service: rude and slow. i especially disliked the server who grabbed my menu from me and turned the pages instead of answering my question. nobody was particularly friendly. we nearly laughed when they asked us if we would be having dessert this evening? later that evening: we both felt sick and bloated after this meal. i do not usually leave such negative comments feel free to check my other reviews if you would like but this experience was so terrible that it was worth my time and effort. overall: there is no way a restaurant like this can survive in the competitive chicago market.i don't know how it still exists. please do not head to cafe orchid on a monday night. if you do, watch out for the medium built, long haired server who doesn't smile.",

    "came here on a casual friday date night with my fiance. the outer aesthetics leave more to be desired; the interior of the restaurant is very cozy. we came at 7 pm and had to wait for a couple of minutes for a table as a large party was being held. this was our first time eating at the restaurant but had had food catered through our church at a recent luncheon. we had the shepherd salad with feta which was light and refreshing. i made a special request for vegetables to come alongside the baba ganoush and our server was very accommodating and suggested they could serve it with cut up cucumber slices (instead of the delicious pita bread they offer as i am attempting to adhere to a gluten free diet). for our entrees, my fiance had the chicken kabobs with bulgar which he said was great and the chicken was flavorful and moist. i had the orchid's favorite chicken drum sticks marinated in olive oil, lemon and herbs. the chicken drum sticks were aaaaamazing! and i never ever ever get excited about chicken. in fact, i think it's the most boring thing to order and rarely ever order it when out to eat. for desert, i had large slices of pumpkin served with what seemed like a honey, clove, and cinnamon drizzle. it was just what my sweet tooth needed. we will definitely be back for more!",

    "i went here this past summer with some friends (3 plus myself). we sat on the patio and brought our own booze which was awesome. we immediately were greeted by the busser, who gave us waters and offered to get us glasses and to open our wine for us. they were off to a great start, which took a turn once our waitress showed up. i used to be a waitress so i know there are just those days where you either just don't feel like being at work that day or personal stuff gets carried over into your work, so i get it! but this girl was so horrific that my only assumption can be this was her first serving job. like i said we were a party of 4 so not a large party that someone could potentially drop the ball on. in short, the only time we actually seen our waitress is when she was dishing out attitude and giving us blank stares as if she didn't understand english or though the glass in the back of the house talking amongst her co workers. pretty sure she was talking about us to, since there were looks at our table from her co workers. a good hint to remember when serving, don't talk about your customers when they can see you.just saying! the busser ended up, in our eyes, becoming our server. i wish i would have got her name to give her the proper credit deserved. she checked on us constantly and got us anything we asked for (which was not a lot). unfortunately for the waitress, the busser got our tip (65.00) in cash personally handed to her and the waitress received nothing. the food was terrific.it was chewed down by all of us, not a crumb left. the service sucked but was made up for. and a fantastic intimate atmosphere. definitely would go back, but would just try my best to avoid the section of that waitress.",

    "meh. that's really the only word i can think of to describe cafe orchid. we had a party of 3, with a reservation and even though the place was pretty empty the staff seemed to be extremely confused about the concept of reservation. we were eventually sat at a table meant for 2, but a chair was added so that i could sit down. this is normally fine, but my chair was right in the middle of the walking path from the kitchen the back dining area. seating aside we sat down to order. i'm a big fan of gyro meat, so the gyro meat plate sounded delicious with it's turkish spices and all. i think the other people in our party got chicken kabobs and lamb kabobs, which would have normally been my choice, but the gyro meat sounded delicious. the other 2 ordered without any issues, but when it came time for me to order it's as if the waitress all of a sudden didn't speak english. the gyro plate came with a side, so i asked for rice, which is clearly labeled as a side on the menu, but she looked extremely confused. she questioned my choice of rice and i repeated myself, not a big deal, but then she asked me if i wanted the butter sauce. ok, this is odd i thought. there was no mention of any sauce on the menu next to that item, so i wasn't sure what she was asking. when i questioned it she really had no clue, so i said sure. butter sauce sounds delicious anyways. i thought it would just be a light coating of butter on the rice. wow was i wrong. our food came and the kabobs with rice looked amazing so i couldn't wait to try my gyro meat with rice and buttery sauce, but that excitement was soon smashed into pieces. it was as if a mirror shattered in my head as the plate was set in front of me. the gyro meat itself looked amazing and i imagine the rice would have too, if there were any on my plate, but i couldn't tell because half of my plate was covered with a thick, creamy looking white sauce. cream and i don't get along so i couldn't really eat it, and since it was touching some of the gyro meat it inherently killed any chance of eating all the gyro meat. and of course, there was no rice. i didn't want to complain because i knew this was the butter sauce that i had ordered, so it wasn't a mistake on their part. and if i had asked about the rice they either would have said i asked for butter sauce or just have brought it on a separate plate. i just decided to eat around the sauce and get as much meat into my face hole as i could, but that doesn't mean i can't still be bitter about it. the meat itself was delicious and i would go back again, but i will absolutely remember not to order the butter sauce again.",

    "my wife and i discovered this place after moving to the neighborhood. holy moly this food rocks! we've since ordered takeout from this place almost every week. the chicken kebab with bulger may be the best middle eastern food i've ever had. so flavorful, well cooked. amazing. better than the special kebab. try it and try other stuff. we love it so much that we're afraid to try anything else for fear of it not being as good! downsides: the actual restaurant is kindof a trainwreck. hole in the wall in a strip mall. i can deal with that, but it's not the cleanest looking place. needs an extreme makeover (the restaurant, not the food). also, sometimes the phone just rings no message or system to indicate whether it is open. kindof random. these are the only things that prevented me from giving it 5 stars.",

    "two girlfriends and i came here for dinner on a friday night. cafe orchid has a parking lot, which is fabulous, but it was full. however, we were easily able to find street parking very nearby. there's a wine store just south of cafe orchid, so we wandered over there to grab some bottles to byob. upon entering we were asked if we had a reservation. we did not, and were told to wait. fortunately we got what i think was the last unreserved table in the restaurant (subsequent diners who came in without reservations were told to return in 30 45 minutes). we started with the babaganoush, which was fantastic. it was wonderfully garlicky (lots of times restaurants use way too light a hand with the garlic). for mains i got the uskudar (lamb cubes sauteed with veggies) and my friends got the vegetable stew and the vegetable combination. my uskudar was okay, but way, way too salty (and i love salt, if i think something's too salty it's actually inedible for most of the population). one of my friends reported the stew was excellent but the friend with the vegetable combination plate said it was just average. up to this point i probably would have given cafe orchid 3 stars, but from here things got weird. the servers had been sort of stand offish up to this point we'd even joked that our waiter clearly hated us but we were willing to overlook it. we still had about a half bottle of wine left and were enjoying sitting and chatting. at this time it was 9:15 45 minutes before the restaurant closed. there were empty tables, other diners had just received their entrees, and there was no one waiting. it became very clear the restaurant staff wanted us to leave. they ceased refilling our water and didn't ask us if we wanted dessert or coffee. we actually felt so much hostility that we decided to order dessert to justify our continued lingering. we had to flag a member of the wait staff down to ask for a dessert menu. we ordered dessert (we still weren't offered coffee and our water glasses were never again refilled). i will say the rice pudding i ordered was delicious. when the time came to pay the bill we asked to split it between three credit cards. look, i know this is annoying. either do it or just say you can't. what you should not do is literally roll your eyes at us as our waiter did. he took our checks and credit cards, ran them, and returned to the table where he literally threw the receipt down without a word. no thank you for coming. no have a good night. if you're going to have a byob restaurant, you have to expect people will linger. my friends and i try really hard not to be obnoxious diners. we weren't the last ones left in the restaurant by a long shot and we ordered appetizers, mains, and dessert. the hostile attitudes we received from the waitstaff were unjustified and made us extremely uncomfortable. no matter how good the food may (or may not) be, i'm never returning to this restaurant.",

    "how many glasses of raki can you drink? i stopped at 3. the petite, lovely young lady dining at the table next to ours laughed when i informed her about my less than stellar drinking prowess. that's it? she exclaimed as she took another sip of the exotic milk colored drink to further quash my masculinity. all i could do was shrug. my women fighting days are long behind me especially after that ass whopping i received in 2008. incredible friends (old and new). great food. and a turkish drink i'm still not sold on it's byob, we brought bourbon and raki. that pretty much encompasses my dining experience at this lakeview gem. the next time or perhaps the first and only time you're invited out for an evening of raki and fish, you best jump at the opportunity. my friend and his wife brought me here, claiming it was the best turkish food in all of chicago. i'll go a step further, and put it as one of the best restaurants in chicago. fun, fresh and a great place to socialize with your crew. the turkish pizza was a sensational appetizer bread topped with lamb and assorted vegetables. i crammed three slices into my mouth and followed it with a few sips of raki. is this heaven? the shepherd's salad was light, crisp and refreshing. i also like that you can use your hands to pile it onto your plate, and no one will judge. the main course was fish, a chilean sea bass head and eyes still intact, which might be off putting to some, but not me. i like to stare my meal in the face, show it who's boss as i delicately cut into its flesh and subtly laugh. if that's not your cup of tea, or if you aren't that sadistic, i suggest ordering one of the lamb dishes. i don't remember the names of the lamb dishes i sampled, but they were both delicious. one comes with pita bread and veggies like a turkish gyro. the other is served in a spicy red sauce. we ended the evening with a nightcap, drinking raki i opted for the bourbon with the owner and our new friends at the adjacent table. cafe orchid and raki definitely helps bring people together.",

    "cafe orchid was just the ticket for us on a warm summer evening. it has a nice indoor dining room, of course, and also a good deal of more casual outdoor seating, which we chose. it was pleasant in spite of the westerly sun and the din from addison, lincoln, and the ravenswood trains. staff members were polite, though a little aloof, and there seemed to be a small language barrier at one point. the menu has many tempting turkish choices for both omnivores and herbivores. we started with fried feta wraps they were tasty and crispy, not greasy at all. entrees are served with a salad and a choice of rice or bulgur. i tried doner kebab it had wonderful flavor, and the salad and bulgur were both much better than i had expected. my companion's lamb skewers kebab was quite good, as well everything was flavorful and cooked just right. i attempted to order an especially appealing dessert from the menu (i cannot remember the name), but got rice pudding instead. when i inquired, i was told that the dessert i wanted is seasonal not available right now. apparently, the server tried to tell me this, but i did not understand what she was getting at. the rice pudding was, however, enjoyable. prices are reasonable and it's byo, so we had an affordable good time. there's also limited parking in an adjacent free lot. i hope to return soon to explore the menu further!",

    "how often do you drive by a place not even knowing its there to later discover its not to be missed ever again. that is the tale of the cafe orchid. i have driven by this place for many a year until one day i noticed it and thought ehhh. then i read a review saying it was byob looked at the menu and went hmmmm. if you have been driving by with out a glace take a peek at the corner of lincoln and addison and you will find a great meal at a reasonable price. what is turkish food its feta its stuffed grape leaves its lamb its yogurt sauce its good. let me tell you what we had we started with the feta plate a nice selection of fresh crisp cucumbers tomatoes olives and feta it was light and fresh perfect for a summer night. and if it is a nice summer night eat out side they have a covered patio so if it does rain it will just add atmosphere. next we had the stuffed grape leaves that come on a bed of lettuce with a great dressing on it. the grape leaves where so good we used restraint so we could bring 2 home and eat them later they where creamy and flavorful a real treat not a hard dense glop of rice like so many are also served cold and yummy. for entrees we had the lamb shish kebabs with bulgar wheat juice moist meat and a nice serving size the wheat was creamy and delicious very good if you crave lamb this is the place. last we had kiymali pide a thin dough like pizza they place the filling which is ground lamb mozzarella cheese and turkish spices in the middle keeping the perimeter like a big crust then they roll the side over the filling and its kept flat like a pizza. it comes out piping hot and they cut it in slices it come with hot sauce and yogurt sauce its crispy dough not like a pizza could be a great appetizer for 2 or more people. staff is very friendly and place is cute byob is perfect. take my advice and open your eyes on the corner of lincoln and addison and stop in for a bite.",

    "after a trip to istanbul and izmir earlier this year, i had to try some turkish cuisine in chicago. i was excited to come too because maybe it meant i could speak some turkish to the wait staff too. we came a little late without reservation, and for some reason i looked confused. i think i said something funny as one of the waitresses said they didn't have any tables available. i was semi let down, but 3 seconds later she said they had one outside. pretty good. the good thing was the outside reminded me partially of a place i ate at in a village near the black sea (i.e. rustic). since i had grown accustomed to drinking some amazing elma cay (apple tea) in nargile gardens and on the street, i wanted some of that badly and hoped this place would have some great stuff. we ordered some mucver (zuchini fritters), lentil soup, and the lamb iskender (tomato sauce). first, the mucver were larger than i expected, but still very good and piping hot. the dill/yogurt/garlic/feta dipping sauce could have been better, but no complaints. the lentil soup was a standard lentil. not amazing, but not bad by any means. my lamb iskender was very, very good and actually better than the few i had tried in turkey. i would recommend this dish (and please, get it with tomato sauce). the only let down was the tea since it was bagged tea. it was decent, but i was somehow hoping for the real deal and to be taken back to what i deemed the opium den in sultanahmet. for dessert, i had the kazandibi, which again, was very good. funniest thing was i had ordered in turkish to my waitress, but i thought she didn't understand what i was ordering. at the end, she did notice my tesekkurler and got excited. i guess not many guests speak turkish there and she wasn't used to it! overall, what i had was very good as a whole and i will be back shortly to have more of the menu. i would recommend to anyone who likes turkish cuisine.",

    "after a recent two week vaction in turkey, we were anxious to see what a turkish restaurant at home would be like. we especially wanted to have kunefe for dessert, because we never were able to find it during our travels. we started with an appetizer of fried mussels. mussels are a big item in turkey, but we were warned that it was easy to get sick from them while we were there, and we weren't in an anthony bourdain frame of mind during our trip. we never saw any fried mussels while there. very solid appetizer. the other appetizer we got was the spinach pie, which we ate a lot of while we were there. it was no different at cafe orchid. my entree was the lamb iskender with a nice spicy butter sauce, accompanied with bulgur. that was pretty much how i remembered this dish when i was there. well done, cafe orchid. my wife enjoyed the imam firin, which is an eggplant dish. dessert was kunefe, which i hadn't had since anatoli kabob was open in lincoln square quite a few years ago. i'm going to let the reader google this, because i'm not going to do the dish justice with a description here. suffice it to say, this is a great dessert, and our undying quest for kunefe had finally come to an end. my wife liked the turkish coffee, but i think my turkish tea wasn't quite as strong here. that stuff kept me awake for those two weeks for sure. we had fun discussing our trip with our waiter, who hailed from ankara. we got to sit out on the patio, and the weather couldn't have been better. the pace was very relaxed, and the atmosphere was inviting. parking was tricky, but we found plenty of spaces south of the intersection on lincoln, though we had to pay. it is byob for those who are so inclined. definitely worth a visit if you are into turkish cuisine.",

    "just went with the wife and kids, my dad and sister and we tried a lot of stuff. i was raised with greek food, which shares much with turkish food and i have been to turkey and other turkish restaurants here. i would say the food is very good, not expensive and it is a comfortable, cozy place. i can't even remember all the dishes we had but i'll try to describe as best i can. we started with dolma (very good and different stuffing from greek dolmadas) the appetizer sampler (humus, babaganoush, taboule, sauted spinach and a lentil fingers (better than it sounds) all very good. also imam biyaldi (stuffed baby eggplant) very tasty. the kids split a plate of fries and spinach pie. adults had felafel, lamb chops(ottoman special) and kulbasti (grilled thin sliced filet mignon with a potato salad unlike any other i've had). again, all fresh stuff, tasty not too spicy. i like spicy but i have had turkish dishes where the garlic is overpowering not here. for desert we had baklava (with pistachios) and revani (same as greek). both very good. only (minor) complaints they were out of 2 of the better looking deserts the pumpkin one and the vanilla pudding (with figs and cherries). other small complaint i like to try new stuff and the waitress highly recommended ayran. it's a yogurt drink and it was very salty. i guess if you were raised with stuff maybe. that said, when i asked for a gazoz (think cream soda) instead, the waitress unhesitatingly made the switch. there's not much specially for kids but i thought it was plenty kid friendly. we ate outside you are basically in a parking lot but the many flowers hide you from that fact quite well. we will definitely return good food, good service and very reasonable prices.",

    "the wait is over! finally, i am extremely happy to let you all chicagoans know that i found the place to enjoy the best turkish and mediterranean food. i am turkish and i know how the food tastes back home and trust me, some dishes at cafe orchid are better than the ones served at home. the menu is very extensive including mezes (tapas), salads, meat dishes, kebabs, vegetarian dishes while you are getting very good size portions. what i really loved about the menu is that it had a lot of home food dishes. like the stuff my mom cooks when i am back home. definitely, do pay attention and order the items labeled recommended on the menu. if you have any questions ask for mr. kurtulus. he is the chef and owner of cafe orchid and best of all he is a very delightful person to speak to. he explains the dishes and help you to choose and answer the questions you may have. service was also amazing. i have not had a minute without the water or bread and the servers were all very nice and polite. the prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of the food you are getting. although it is a byob restaurant, i strongly suggest you try raki (much better than your grandma's ouzo). you will be served in a very traditional way and will never want to drink anything else with this kind of food. :) lastly, just like in turkey, no meal is complete without the turkish black tea. cafe orchid serves tea at the end of your meal again in a very traditional way. i am looking forward to go back at the earliest time. until then, enjoy! murat",

    "i once was riding with cab driver from turkey who commented that i live near one of the most authentically turkish restaurants around. well. i suppose he would know! all i can say is this place is fantastic. the food is delicious and there are plenty of vegetarian options. my favorite is the vegetable stew with bulgar. thick broth filled with veggies and big cloves of roasted garlic, i order this hot dish even in the summer. the bread here is dangerous. served piping hot and in small pieces it's easy to eat more of it than you intend to. byob with no corkage fee makes this an affordable, fun dinner spot. the atmosphere is nice once you get inside, the set up is a little odd as the entry way essentially deposits you into the kitchen area. even better is the outdoor patio in the summer. lined with large plants and twinkle lights it's easy to forget you're sitting right on addison. they do accept reservations which i would recommend, especially on a weekend night!",

    "this restaurant is terrific! we ate there again on valentine's night. as usual, we were welcomed graciously and chef kurt, now a long time friend, came out to give us both a hug. we had been to istanbul over new year's and told him that while the food there was delicious, it didn't come close to his. there was a price fix menu that night, although you could also order off the regular menu. how they did that meal for 25 pp is beyond me. a large cold, and a large hot plate of appetizers. then the entree and we went for the swordfish. not only was it seasoned and cooked to perfection (you know how swordfish can be easily overcooked), but the plate also had some grilled veggies, rice and a nice chopped salad. then, to finish, a dessert plate with some strawberry, a jello heart, and a nice sized piece of very moist cake. i read a couple of the 'bad reviews' and was pretty surprised. to the young woman who was all shook up because she wanted 2 of whatever and they come 5 to an order. duh, you freeze what you don't eat. and, if you want it 'your way' go to mickey ds. except you never get it anyway but 'their way' and it'll kill you to boot. more fat, more salt, wrapped in sugar. to the person who said they had just come back from turkey and the food was so much better there: where did you eat in turkey? no food, none, that we ate was anywhere close to chef kurt's. and virginia, you were 'super confused' by the door? omg! tragedy! thrown for a loop! stay home, it's safer.",

    "so, i've never had turkish food before, so i had no clue what to expect. what i should have expected was delicious food in a cute atmosphere at very reasonable prices! i sat outside in the patio (on the west side of the restaurant). it is a nice space the tables are not too crammed in and we were there during the week, when it wasn't super crowded, so we got our pick of tables. our server came immediately with wine glasses and menus. the atmosphere is kind of quirky and cute. a 4. our server was so sweet. we wanted to get 1/2 portions of two appetizers and she was willing to ask about it. she was really friendly, but not overbearing. service was most definitely a 5. the food itself was so delicious! the hummus was wonderful. i had a lamb entree with some sort of yogurt sauce delicious! food is a 5. value is really great. this is a byo first of all, but the pricing is extremely reasonable. a 5 for value. i didn't visit the bathrooms, so i'll have to go average on this one. overall a 4 skewing to a 5. this is an all around great spot! i will definitely want to visit again.",

    "after spending the morning window shopping on lincoln avenue, i came by cafe orchid for a leisurely late lunch. indecisive but in search of some salad with a little protein on the side, i ordered the mixed kebab platter sans rice and with yogurt sauce. although a bit pricey at nearly 20, it came with a wealth of meat (steak, chicken, gyro, and kibbe) and a giant salad with a grilled tomato and pepper dressed in a simple oil and vinegar dressing. the light salad completely hit the spot on a warm august afternoon, and the grilled tomato was the proverbial cherry on the sundae. not to be outdone, the chicken came out grilled, juicy, and flavorful as did the gyro. my friend couldn't keep his mitts off the steak chunks, and i absolutely loved the kibbe. it ate like hamburger with a greek accent and a healthy levity. i took enough meat home for two more meals, but i could not resist consuming all the kibbe with my salad and bread at the table. i also could not resist asking for a little more yogurt sauce to go. i wish everything in life could be as simple and delicious as cafe orchid's kebab platter on a sunny summer day.",

    "cafe orchid is an excellent authentic turkish restaurant! my first visit there was about a year ago when a group of turkish and american friends organized a fun evening at cafe orchid's patio. we were all impressed by the quality of food and the friendly service who had no problem handling a large crowd like ours (we were about 12). then, this year i went back with three other moms from my son's school, who had never had a taste of turkish cuisine before. we had the most amazing lunch that included: kofte (meatballs), chicken shish kebob, rice pilaf, piyaz (white bean salad), sigara borek (rolled pastry stuffed with feta cheese), mercimek kofte (red lentil fingers), turlu (mixed veggies), turkish flat bread, ayran (yogurt drink) and to top it all, the most delicious revani (semolina sponge cake in syrup, served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream). we were all drooling over every single dish. my friends were very impressed with the variety, the flavors and the quality of everything. the meat (both kofte and chicken shish kebob) could not be any juicier and more flavorful. all of us said we would definitely come back with our families! finally, last friday, cafe orchid catered a superb lunch at my son's elementary school in the north shore. we repeated the same menu that we tasted earlier; this time for over 80 kids, teachers and parents. it was a feast to all my senses as well as to my heart! it was amazing to see how many kids came back to get their second serving! my special thanks to kurtulus serpin, the owner and master chef of cafe orchid, and his team for far exceeding my expectations! cafe orchid will definitely be a regular stop for my family. i highly recommend it to anyone looking for high quality authentic food in a warm, friendly setting.",

    "delicious and charming turkish place just off the addison brown line stop. met up there with friends on a thursday night, and we were seated right away. i'm not even going to attempt to spell the name of the dish i had, but essentially, it was lamb wrapped in roasted eggplant. i love lamb, i love eggplant, and the menu called outhighly recommended next to its listing, so i didn't hesitate in ordering this, and it turned out to be the perfect choice. absolutely wonderful, especially on a cold chicago night. this was my first experience with turkish cuisine, so i can't claim to know that it was authentic, but judging by the staff and decor, i'd say it's a safe bet. i really appreciated that the menu included thorough descriptions of the fare for those of us not familiar with turkish cuisine. prices are incredibly reasonable, too! would definitely return!",

    "as much as i felt guilty cheating on my greek yiayia by eating here, i was pretty surprised on how close they measured up. byo first of all and parking which are two huge bonuses. we called and made a reservation and sat in the cute enclosed patio area. we started with hummus which came out with my favorite turkish flat bread with the seeds on top = love.love.love.love. i then had to go for a chicken kebab because i knew these would be authentic and let me tell you, they were damn close to the ones i was raised on in little turkish restaurants in brooklyn growing up (thanks for setting the bar high yiayia!) the chicken was soo tender and seasoned just right. it came paired with rice and traditional salad with balsamic dressing. boom, perfect dinner which left me feeling perfectly full. i kind of wish the yogurt sauce was more like greek tzatziki sauce but it's all good. i will definitely make this a byo staple restaurant going forward :)",

    "cafe orchid warmed my heart. we sat in the tented area, which was intimate and inviting. the night was rainy, and the sound of the drops overhead was romantic and almost musical. we weren't on a date, but you could have fooled me. the bread that came with everything we ordered was hot from the oven and replenished throughout our meal. it was thicker than pita, crisp on the outside and soft in the middle a true pleasure to pull apart. the baba ganoush was good, but the serving was scant for six bucks. the sultan's delight was the star of our meal. slow cooked lamb served with char grilled eggplant puree and sauteed with just a hint of mozzarella cheese.it was fit for a sultan indeed. the service was sweet as sugar, and may even have out shined the food, in a good way. byob? you bet i will. hint: trader joe's is just a stone's throw up lincoln, and i don't know a better place to get good wine for cheap. cafe orchid maintains a warm, quaint feeling despite its size. you'd never believe how big it is! from the outside it looks tiny. we were lucky enough to witness a giant party of 30 some odd turkish people in no holds barred revelry. i don't always love to share restaurants with other people's parties, but these folks emanated sheer joy, and it was a pleasure to see such radiant smiles and witness such rollicking laughter. they had a boombox bumping turkish music and they stood and sang along, arms around each other, with some kind of traditional turkish booze in hand. imagine our surprise when our server suggested we stay for the belly dancer they had brought with them! the dancing kicked the carousal up a notch, which i wouldn't have thought possible. these people really knew how to party. i wish they would always be there. our experience was wonderful, and i look forward to going back. i highly recommend it for a romantic rainy night, a place for a (byob!) party, or both.",

    "full disclosure i have plenty of reasons to be biased for/against this place. i myself am turkish, and my father was raised in adana the same town the chef here is from. cafe orchid's recipes are extremely similar to what i grew up with. this is definitely comfort food to me that said, the service and quality of food here are unparalleled, and this is (for my money) the best, most authentic turkish dining experience available in chicago. every time i dine here, i bring a friend or family, and whether or not they grew up with turkish food, they agree it's a fantastic dining experience. truth told, i (almost literally) stumbled on this place. last summer, i went to a friend of a friend's housewarming party. it had been just a bit awkward until a couple passes at the ipa kegs. after a couple hours, i had made friends with most of the people there. then i got the feeling, the one you get when you realize you got a lot drunker than intended, and you'd better escape before the ready supply of alcohol causes a messy faux pas. with a vague understanding of my surroundings, i decided to amble down addison, looking to catch the damen back to my neck of the woods. besotted and hungry, i smelled something delicious as i approached the el lines at wood. at first glance, cafe orchid was like a mirage to me. the food smelled heavenly, the outdoor seating (simple patio tables with canopies and strung lights) was a dead ringer for many of the restaurants i remembered visiting when i was a kid on vacation in turkey, and the menu was filled with food i forgot existed. dazed, i took a seat in the takeout area, ordering an adana kebob and turkish soda. the friendly and efficient waitstaff were kind enough not to pay too much attention to a visibly drunk, awed man. after a brief 15 minute wait or so, i received the food and made for the bus home. the total time to get home was about 30 minutes and even after 30 minutes for the food to cool down (i ate it out of the take out box, out of excitement as much as necessity) the meal was fantastic. i swore to myself that i would start bringing friends there. the byob policy makes it an easier sell, and my friends and i (who have tried a wide array of meals, including most kebabs, the iskender, manti, taze fasulye, and falafel special) swear by it as one of the best restaurants in the city. it's hard for me to advocate too hard for this restaurant. i would absolutely recommend this to just about anybody. there are plenty of options for adventurous diners, but if you're concerned about the exoticness of turkish food, rest assured that they have ample kebab options with familiar foods. the byob makes this a cheaper dinner than the entree prices would make you think. the service is fantastic (i've spoken to the owner a couple times and he's extremely friendly). the outdoor patio is also a wonderful place for a date when it's warm out. give this place a shot even if it's a little out of the way, you don't get an opportunity to visit a restaurant like this often in chicago.",

    "moderately priced and really tasty turkish food, i'm a fan of the kabobs. this can be a really fun place for a larger group, especially if you get a spot on the patio. if you are looking for a byob for lots of rowdy friends, as is usually the case for me, then this place is very hit or miss. the restaurant tries for more romantic setting and can be very low key when there are lots of couples. this however hasn't stopped my friends and i from polishing off a few bottles of rum at this place :) overall, this is a perfect place for a date night but is hit or miss for a large group of drinkers.",

    "rich food. i wanted to take my big bro out for his pre birthday. had to be byo. had to be quiet. had to be delicious. a quick search showed orchid cafe. it's in a strange spot that used to be a diner a while ago. i am happy to see the space transformed but it is a disjointed space. the old diner barely had enough room for 10 people. but this place was expanded and now has a private room next to ashland addison. there's also a parking spot taken up with the patio. when we got there on a tuesday night it was mostly empty. we were seated right away but it took a little time to get served. on recommendation we did the cold and hot appetizer plates. for mains, we had a chicken kebob and chicken iskender. for my taste, the kebob was just as it should be: flavorful and moist. with all the other fixings and our lingering apps, we made many tasty options on pita. the iskender, on the other hand, was strange. that might be the best word for it. it was tasty in the same way experimental dishes i make at home for myself only is tasty. it was very rich, buttery, salty. and that was the bread. the chicken was made with the same care as was the kebob dish. mixed on this one. to finish we had some turkish coffee (excellent) and attempted a flan which was the perfect amount of sweetness. overall, this place is quite good. i think the dishes must be acquired taste because everything else at the table was very nice. for the food we ate our bill was about 85. not bad considering we were there nearly 3 hours catching up and chit chatting with the server.",

    "found cafe orchid on yelp while looking for a place to meet my girlfriend for dinner. service was very good. and yes, as the other reviewer stated, the wait staff is adorable as long as you aren't one of those people who doesn't like dealing with broken english speaking staff. our waitress came back three times to clarify our order but everything was correct and very good. had to wait for my date so started with a turkish coffee to kill time. it was excellent! sultan delight entree, which says highly recommended on the menu, was delicious. my girlfriend had the yogurt lamb kabobs which were also very good. the restaurant feels old, its a little dark but very quaint. the tent area is well heated if you choose to sit there when it is cold out. will definitely head back there some time to try out more of the menu.",

    "to start this review on an honest note, i'll admit that we didn't intend to come here. while the lack of food at home meant we'd have to eat lunch at a restaurant, our original plan was to go elsewhere. however, elsewhere was closed. cafe orchid it is! quick! get in here! it's cold outside! our adorable server asks if we want to sit on the patio. while this isn't as insane as it sounds (said patio is covered with a winter tent thing), i was still worried it would be cold. it's december, people. this ended up being the best seat in the house i could feel the sun on my face without the winter chill. perfect. aforementioned adorable server answers many questions about the menu: what is adana? what comes with the falafel special? what are feta wraps? (answers: spicy lamb. hummus, baba ghanoush, and a green salad. turkish eggrolls). frankly, she was so cheery and helpful she could have brought me a plate of sticks and rocks and i would have enjoyed myself. our feta wraps came first, and they were exactly as described. thin eggrolls minus eggroll innards plus feta. i had a great time mixing sauces and scraping up every little bit. next, the falafel special. boyfriend had the adana special. both of us were completely overwhelmed with the amount of food we'd gotten for almost no money. seriously, my plate (about 8) was filled to overflowing. yes, i ate every last bit. adorable server encouraged us to come back for dinner sometime. no worries, lady, i already have my next meal planned (the leek and olive oil special).",

    "4.5 i came here with a group of 12 people on a thursday night. first things first. from the moment we called them with a group reservation they were helpful and very accommodating. we changed our numbers a little bit and they were nothing but friendly with each change. the bread was amazing (it comes on the table as soon as you sit down). we started with hummus and felafel. yup yup yup. the hummus was fresh and very tasty, nice and smooth. for dinner i ended up having the appetizer sampler cause i was in the mood to try a bunch of things. my other table mates tried a wide array of menu items. our waiter was really helpful in suggesting dishes and took lots of time with each person that ordered. when our food came out some of em had no idea what they had actually ordered (which made for a really funny passing of dishes experience). i tried a bunch of em and everything had unique flavors. i can't wait to go back and try more food. the only reason i give a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that our food was taking a while (yes, we expected this we had 12 people) and our waiter was no where to be found. it was a little frustrating because people were looking to get more water. the same thing happened after we ate. we ended up having to get up and ask them for the check. it wasn't a big deal because we were all enjoying our dinner and the conversations.",

    "decent food. our waitress ada was awesome, unique, and hilarious. we asked her when she works to make sure we have her wait on us on our next visit. back to the food, it tasted fine. i wasn't into the tabuli, the turkish coffee was pretty great, be prepared for the sludge at the bottom if you've never had, and my kebob meal was fine. we took some food home. the only problem was that my stomach didn't agree with the spices used. if my stomach can handle it, i'll definitely try this place again. ps its byob",

    "this place serves its purpose. first of all, reza's should be removed from anybody's vocabulary. that place is an insult to middle eastern/persian food, and it's only popular because of the marketing dollars they spend by choosing to rent in river north. now that that's out of the way. cafe orchid has a large menu with lots of items that will please anybody. i mean that. there are vegetarian options, meats, and plain old rice. who could argue with that? i especially like the byo factor. i had some of the sampler appetizer plates, but i particularly enjoyed my meat pies, uskudar, and the sultan's delight. the setting is very low key, so it's a nice casual option that also incorporates culture.",

    "finally some decent middle eastern food! after being disappointed by reza's(bleh), my roommate and i decided to try cafe orchid as it's so close to our place. we were starving so we ended up ordering a bunch of dishes and took the rest home. appetizer sampler (hummus, babaganoush, taboule, lentil fingers, and sauteed spinach) awesome! everything was fresh and perfectly seasoned and the hummus was definitely above average. the sauteed spinach was a bit bland. the spinach salad and sheppard salad were both great starters (huge portions, too) and all of the vegetables were extremely fresh. felafel was standard but still tasted great. the zucchini pancakes were a bit too eggy but tasted pretty good with the yogurt dip. 4 stars for slow ish service, but this place is definitely worth a try if you want delicious turkish food!",

    "i have to go with 2 stars for this place. i was really disappointed with my last visit. we walked in around 6pm because we didn't have a reservation. we figured we'd have to go early since we didn't reserve a table and the patio was about 1/4 full when we got there. they asked us if we had a reservation, and since we didn't, we agreed to sit inside. it was about 12,000 degrees in there. my husband was sweating almost immediately. not only that, but their boombox stereo was so loud (i'm assuming so the patio guests could hear it) that most of my conversation was what was that? i'm sorry, could you repeat that? and pointing to my ear and shrugging. our waitress was not very attentive. our water glasses were not refilled and with how much we were sweating, this was somewhat of a big deal. we brought a bottle of wine, which we almost completely finished before our meal arrived because we were so hot and therefore thirsty. so we're half in the tank, starving (because the food took a long time to come out) and dehydrated. not comfortable at all. the nail in the coffin was the food. it just wasn't good. we had the stuffed grape leaves as an appetizer. neither of us have ever had this dish anywhere, so maybe we just didn't like it, but i couldn't even finish one. he had the uskudar. i had the sultan's delight or hunkar begendi, which are both highly recommended. both have lamb in them, and the lamb was gristly and did not have a good flavor to it. after trying to choke down a few bites of mine, my husband graciously agreed to switch dinners with me, since he can pretty much eat anything (though he was not impressed either). so we switched, and while the flavor of the uskudar was much more appealing to me thanks to the eggplant, the lamb was still not very good. i thought it may be just because i don't eat lamb often, so maybe i don't like it in general, but i had a lamb chop later that same week at another restaurant and scarfed the thing. so, we finally finish our meal and have to walk through the patio to leave. half the tables are still empty and haven't been seated since we got there. it was really disappointing. i have been here to pick up lunch before, and i really enjoyed their grilled veggie with hummus. i would think about picking this up again in the future, but i'll never go back for a sit down meal ever again.",

    "so apparently i have never reviewed this place before but i go quite often so i guess that my duty as a yelper calls. being a small little turkish cafe the inside is about as cheesy as you would expect. there's even a tv that always has some turkish soccer game on as well. more importantly, the food: the bread comes right out of the oven and is great.it's not pita bread and it isn't a traditional loaf of italian type bread either but it's awesome. there is a lunch menu and a dinner menu. i always get the gyros hummus plate and it is about the best thing you would ever want to put in your mouth outside a bedroom. be sure you ask for a side of the hot sauce as it just makes the dish. the hummus is perfect! i even had them make this for me when i came to dinner one night and it didn't seem to be a big problem.for me anyway. as to anything else on the menu, i can't really say. i have tried the falafel and they are good too but i found the best dish and i am sticking with it. i wouldn't mind trying something else for dinner some time but for lunch this is the way to go. it is byob so remember that. the outdoor seating, if available is definitely a step up from their indoor dining. now that the old cousins is gone i have to say this is one of my favorite turkish/mid eastern spots in the city.",

    "went here on a friday night and was seated immediately, and it was nice to be outside in the sunshine, since it was a cool summer evening. it is byo which is nice, and they supplied an ice bucket for our white wine, which is always appreciated. the food was pretty good. we got the mushroom appetizer, which was a mushroom cap covered in cheese in a tomato sauce.pretty yummy. we shared the cold appetizer plate, in the entree size. the spicy red pepper dish was delicious, the hummus was creamy and good. the cheese filled phyllo cigars were good too. i felt like the food was slightly salty for my taste though. the cold eggplant section of our dish was not that good it just lacked in taste. i liked the lentil fingers even though my friends didnt. the one that i got had a kick to it i guess that taste was not equally distributed. the service was okay.i felt like everyone time one server would show up, another would show up at the exact time and ask to take your order. it was definitely not a big deal, but just confusing.",

    "although cafe orchid is located on the busy intersection of lincoln and addision, one can easily overlook cafe orchid. it is tucked away in the corner behind the flower shop on the corner. it was only recently that i realized it was a restaurant when i noticed they had a canopy out with outdoor seating. it looked intriguing and it looks pretty busy so we thought it might be an ideal place for a double date, especially since it is byob. the service is attentive, abeit a little over whelming. perhaps our waitress was new, but we noticed that everytime she came over to take our order, another waiter would come along with her and check on us. perhaps she was in training? my bf and i started with the cold appetizer. the hummus is good, smooth and creamy. the smoked eggplant was tasty, the spinach salad was ok, it didn't have much flavor but was a good compliment to the smokiness of the eggplant and the tahini in the hummus. i could have done without the lentil fingers, it didn't taste like anything to me. for our entree, we shared the mixed kabob. i have no idea what they put in the lamb patty that was served with our mixed kabob but i could have eaten like five more of those! it was moist, tender, and it was delicious! with our mixed kabob we also got shaved gyro meat, which, like the lamb, was also very good. my only complaint would be about the chicken and beef which were a bit overcooked so the meat was tough, and left me wishing that they would have given us more of those yummy lamb patties! i think on my next visit, i would like to try another one of their lamb centered dishes as i feel like that is where their speciality lies. i would definitely come back to cafe orchid. i love their outdoor seating. the atmosphere is great, the service is warm and friendly, and their prices are very reasonable. and did i mention that it was byob?",

    "stumbled upon this place last night when we were in the 'hood. we opted to sit in their inside dining room, as their porch was romantically lit by the fluorescent lights spilling in from the kitchen and serenaded by the loud traffic from the nearby intersection. great food overall. highly recommend the tapenade like ezme. it's sharp, refreshing, and just spicy enough. got a big plate of it with warm bread.enough to be able to keep spreading it on my kebab. which brings me to the main course.was feeling healthy, so opted for the chicken kebab. at 13 it's a decent value as it comes with bulgur or rice (i opted for the bulgur which was very flavorful), a crisp and freshly made salad, and cacik (yogurt sauce which they make really well). i thought the chicken itself could have been more heavily seasoned, but it wasn't dry and with the ezme and cacik it didn't really matter. also had the turkish tea, which is great if you're a fan of black tea with o milk and sugar, and boy am i. the baklava for desert was a okay, a bit too soggy on the bottom for my liking. service was attentive. it's byob. bill for two entrees, shared app and desert came in under 40. it's not the best turkish food i've had, but i'll be back.",

    "wow! i am kind of going through a turkish food obession lately but this place doesn't dissapoint. i have been here 3 times now and every time i have left here.happy and full. the service has been on point every time. you have to start out with the hummus. the bread that is comes with is sooo good i would love to lock myself in a closet and eat the whole basket. :) i have gotten several different items each time but the chicken kabob is awesome. the last time i was there i got the orchid's favorite. it was so outstanding. i always get the rice as the side. it's not super fancy but in the summer they have a good patio. it's also a byob so that is of course awesome. i highly suggest this place.",

    "for the first alfresco lunch of the year, amy suggested cafe orchid, hoping that i could find something delicious yet also healthy to enjoy (summer is creepy up fast and this girl needs to lose some more winter pounds). cafe orchid fit the bill perfectly. there are only three tables outside and we were lucky enough to snag one. our waiter was super nice and friendly and service was quick and attentive. all of this would be irrelevant though, if the food wasn't good. but good actually great it was. we each had one of the spinach salads mine with steak which were the perfect warm weather meal. a heaping plate full of spinach, topped with a light, lemony, olive oil dressing, buffalo mozzarella cheese, and tender, perfectly cooked, smokey grilled steak. the bread, and the small brownie the waiter insisted amy try also looked great, but i refrained from trying any. i'll definitely be back, and next time i will byob as well.",

    "i visited cafe orchid with great expectations after reading the comments here. although my friend has warned me that do not expect a lot of things . first things first, they didn't serve anything (like appetizer) while waiting for the main course. negative point! while i was checking the menu, i realized that they indicated iskender as highly recommended, and the waiter adviced me to order it made by doner (gyros) as the original one. i had iskender lots of times in my life, even in the city of bursa, where the original iskender was made first. but, whatever i had in cafe orchid was not iskender, sorry. negative point! after that i tried baklava, and i need to say that their baklava is pretty good. i recommend you to try it, if you have a chance go there. positive! all turkish restaurant (both in turkey and usa, as well) serve traditional turkish tea and it's complimentary. but they didn't! shame on you cafe orchid, it's written authentic turkish cuisine in your outdoor signboard, where is your turkish hospitality? the only hospitable person was the waitress and she was asian. negative point! to sum up, their food is ok, maybe their other main courses are better, but probably i'll not go there again. sorry!",

    "this place is smoking! no wait, that was my wife's coat. upon walking into the restaurant her jacket caught on fire. more on that later. first the good parts: 1. service excellent service throughout the night. we arrived on a busy friday night and they accommodated us best as possible without a reservation. i'd recommend a reservation on a weekend night. the place is pretty small. 2. food oh my, i was delightfully surprised by all the goodness. we ordered the grape leaves, the sultan delight, the yogurt kabob and split the baklava. everything we had was excellent and possibly the best version of the dish we have tried in ages. 3. ambiance very cute, warm and quaint. it has a very welcoming feel to it. 4. byob now to the funny story. upon walking in the door we were told to wait for a moment. we did so by leaning up on this fixture until the hostess came back. while waiting we both commented on the nice little portable fireplaces they had scattered in the front. they looked nice and added some great warmth and ambiance. the front also had this wonderful aroma, almost smelled like burning firewood. the hostess came back and kindly asked to sit in a different area for a few moments. then once they had the tabled cleared, we were picked up by a staff member and escorted to our seat. as we're walking a big cloud of feathers explodes around us. it looked like as if a bird just exploded. it turns out my wife's coat was completely burnt through at the bottom while we were leaning on the fixture in the front. we didn't notice it was actually one of those portable fireplaces. throughout the night the staff continually apologized and asked if we were okay. they threw some free bee's at us as well. we probably could of argued more and asked for them to pay for our meal (or coat). but honestly, we felt partially responsible for not recognizing our surroundings better. plus, to be really honest, that coat sucked. it needed to die.",

    "this place has consistently not disappointed! most recently i was here for a birthday dinner and again thoroughly enjoyed the food. dishes that i recommend trying include the donor kabob, sultan delight, and uskudar. their turkish ravioli is good, but would be tastier if it had more meat filling inside (although a friend of mine told me that's pretty much how this dish is it reminds me of gnocchi, with a bit of meat filling). we brought a birthday cake, and the waitstaff kindly put it in their fridge and brought it out at the end, and even put candles on it for us. there service is a little slower, but definitely not too bad for a place like this. they are also one of the only places i know that doesn't automatically charge gratuity for groups. the prices range from 10 13 a dish, even with appetizers and drinks ended up being less than 20. def recommend going!",

    "i had high hopes after hearing from a couple gal pals about their amazing experience here, but i was disappointed. i'm a fairly low maintenance diner i believe and if i have the basics (good service, good food, fair price) i am usually happy and will spread the word. but this just wasn't the case here. the fold up metal chairs in the tiny little front dining area didn't help the cause. not sure what the second room is like, maybe that's where they have the cozy and comfortable inside dining area, they speak of on their website. i was sort of stiff from the get go. it took too long for anyone to come over to even say hello and when they did, i wondered if we were in trouble here because of the language barrier. i feel bad for saying this, since i was the one going into a turkish restaurant, expecting them to cater more to me, but, i just wondered how well we would fare with this communication problem. i ordered some pretty basic items and ended up having to point to the menu to tell our server what we wanted. even then, he brought us the wrong appetizer. i hate feeling like, 'oh, i don't want to cause a scene and send this back' so i just eat it, even though it's not what i wanted. always bums me out. the bread he brought over to our table was hot and very good. the hummus, even though very oily, tasted pretty good. i couldn't get past the mushiness of the babaganush he brought instead of grilled eggplant salad which i asked for. so i'm not too sure about that. i thought falafels would be done well here, but was mistaken. way too over fried with no flavor. i didn't get past the first bite. there were a couple older women next to us who had ordered a meat platter that smelled wonderful. so i made sure to get what they had, the lamb, plus a few other things in the combo platter. i will say, all of the meats were very good. grilled and well seasoned. as i was finishing dinner and beginning to contemplate something sweet and maybe a coffee, another guy bus boy? came over and started hurriedly taking our plates and cleaning the table while we sat there. he was acting a bit frantic and saying something about our server talking to another table when it was time to close. he kept repeating that they closed at 10:00 and said that server had better get to work because there was a lot to do still. i didn't feel like we had time for dessert at this point and knew we had better get going. it was 10:00 on the dot afterall! so, the check comes and i'm splitting it 50/50. my half should have been about 26. instead, we each get charged 47 what the heck? who is doing the math here? i was so annoyed. and i'm still annoyed because it's 4 days later and this voided charge has yet to appear back in my bank account. i have called twice to tell them they charged me 26 plus the 47 and they have said both times that it will take a few days to correct. annoyed. like i said, friends have told me of their wonderful experiences here. unfortunately, i had just the opposite. i will go elsewhere when i have a taste for turkey.",

    "one of my absolute favorites for turkish food. nice decor and ambiance, easy parking (both at the lot and on surrounding streets), great, fast and friendly service always. i've been going there for 3 years and know almost all servers. when i called to make a reservation while back they recognized me before i said who i was! normally we don't even make a res and just go and never had to wait to get seated. in the spring and summer there is a nice outdoor patio. byob is a big plus, and the place is very reasonably priced. favorite dishes. appetizers: sheppard salad ezme fried beef liver (with marinated onions, very yummy!) cig borek (small meat pie) for dinner we normally get a couple of mix combos and ask to substitute chicken with lamb (their lamb is so tender and flavorful it's a sin to not get as much as possible of it!). then we just share the combos among 4 5 people. it's plenty of food and is so delicious. the rice is excellent too. i spent a month in turkey last year and cafe orchid's food tastes like the wonderful stuff i had overseas!",

    "i went here for lunch ordered a gyro, some hummus, and a soda. while ordering gyro was not the most adventurous selection (on my part) the food has decent enough and reasonably priced. as others have stated the servers are not as attentive as they could be, but the service isn't horrible either. overall, it was a satisfactory (if not somewhat forgettable) lunch. i will probably order something more original next time for lunch. however, dinner was another story. i ordered the iskender with donner, served over pan fried bread with butter and yogurt. this dish was every bit as good as it sounds. the sauce blended perfectly with the meat and the bread. the service was so so, but i'm not one of those people who likes the server checking on me every five minutes anyway. this is a great place for an excellent turkish dinner (its byob also).",

    "this is a tough review to make. because the food tasted amazing! really flavorful and filling. we ordered delivery, and ate while we watched a movie. we got the uskudar lamb in spices, with eggplant and rice and a hummus appetizer. everything was mouth watering and we were satisfied. but then neither of us felt good about an hour later. and for the next 3 days we had major digestive issues. i don't know if it was the grease, the rich lamb or what but something really wrecked us for a few days. i am sad because i want to try this place again, but i am afraid we'll get sick :( probably won't eat here again.",

    "i've been getting food delivered from cafe orchid for some time, but had never been there until recently, when i took a friend. a couple of these reviews have mentioned slow ass service, so i was a little concerned, but we had no problems at all. the delivery menu on grubhub is pretty limited, but i've always been able to find something delicious and healthy ish (although i'm a sucker for the calamari). there's a lot more offered in the actual restaurant, though. the kabobs are fantastic full of flavor and accompanied with a fresh salad and that's what i usually get. (try the bulgur with your meal instead of rice it's kind of like millet, and it's a little oily but delicious.) my friend was a little short on money, so she just got the meat pie appetizer; i had a bite and it was really crispy and good, and they arranged it on her plate so that it looked like a fuller meal. i usually don't care at all about free baskets of bread, but cafe orchid's is buttery and warm, with sesame seeds, and it went beautifully with the meal. we shared a dessert that was like a mix between tiramisu and creme brulee, which are the two desserts guaranteed to make my eyes roll back in my head, and it was incredible. there's no other word for it. we just gaped at each other when it was over. the one gripe i had was that our waiter spoke incredibly quietly. neither my friend or i could really hear him at all i'm a little hard of hearing, but she's not, and it was kind of a pain to ask him to repeat himself several times. if yelp allowed half stars, that's what would bump cafe orchid down to 4.5, but the food is too awesome to take a whole star off. yum.",

    "well, this review is for everything except the food. yes, i know you are thinking to yourself how is this crazy ho going to write a review about a restaurant and omit the food? well, if you stop interrupting and calling me a ho i will tell you. we went to have dinner but i was slammed with the aftereffects of a ridiculous head cold. my entire head felt like it was stuffed with jello and not the yummy lemon kind, more like that gross clear stuff with the hotdogs and celery sticks floating in it. we ordered a couple of appetizers and i got the vegetable stew as my entree. they also gave us some sambal, which i had hoped would firebomb the crap in my nose and allow me to actually taste my food, but instead it just made me cough. and this is a small space so the coughing was extra embarrassing. sorry to everyone who had to listen to me yak up a lung that night. honestly, not intentional. so basically i have no idea what i ate was actually good or not. it sure looked good and the warm stew was a blessing going down my sore throat, but i have to come back when i am well and give it another go. the space is so cute and the service was very polite and efficient it seems a shame not to give them a second chance. plus they have parking and how many places in this area can say that.",

    "came here on a sunday night with four friends. the five of us enjoyed good food and great company. we had reservations and we were seated in the heated outdoor (it's enclosed and quite toasty, no worries there) portion of the restaurant. at first this annoyed me, as we were crammed in a corner with one person basically behind the door and two of us shoved into the wall with no breathing room. when i went in through the main dining room to use the facilities, however, i appreciated where we were sitting a bit more. the main room was filled with large groups and lots of little kids. nothing against kids, but man it was loud in there! we started with the appetizer combo plate. it was solidy ok. we were able to figure out what everything was, but it would have been nice if the waiter had given us an idea (it was really dimly lit hard to read the menu to begin with, much less distinguish between hummus and baba gannoush that looked identical). for entrees, my other companions got kebab dishes. i got 2 appetizers falafel and spinach. i had a bite of the lamb kebab and it was delicious. my dishes were both good but not great. the spinach was served cold (i know it was under the cold appetizers section but it should have been served room temperature, not like it just got out of the refrigerator). it tasted better after i let it warm up in the room a bit. the falafel was ok but not great. what i really wanted to order was the vegetarian combo plate but i just couldn't justify shelling out that much money for it (seriously it cost almost 17. by comparison, the lamb kebabs were 12.) byob which i always appreciate, though i wasn't drinking last night. in all, i'd probably come back, i just won't be in a huge rush to do so.",

    "i have always had an affinity for mediteranean food, whether it be coastal italian or a falafel stand, this is my true love. really a 3.5 service has some serious issues, but there are not a lot of turkish choices out there. cafe orchid does a lot with a little, by this i am refering to a tiny kitchen, barely enough room for anyone to cook, yet they seem unbothered, the menu leaves no hints of the limitations. other reviews mention the room is plain and out dated, i see it differently, i almost didn't notice the banquet style chairs, i was busy looking at the draperies, and select turkish paintings, this is a great example of a slight budget making the most. food wise i wanted to taste more and i will on my future visits. we started with the meat pie, the filling was tasty but served on a mushy salad, the dough was a bit greasy, i still enjoyed it though. my other app. was skewered mussels a very strange preparation. described as skewered and pan fried this oxymoron made us curious enough, what we received were 5 large green lipped mussels, in a batter, not unlike a fish and chips batter, served with an american style cocktail sauce and some lemony sauce that may have contained garlic and tahini. at this point we were concerned about the other things we ordered, but i have to say, beer battered mussels are pretty damn tasty, except for the shell that was in one. the entrees is where this meal came together, my date had the eskender, kind of a gyro style lamb, served over fried bread cubes with yogurt and tomato sauce, the meat was truly amazing, tender, juicy, it tasted nothing like a mass produced gyro. this was one of my favorite meats ever. for my meal i had a ground lamb k bob, served with flat bread and rice, the meat was delicious, moist with grill marks, and perfectly seasoned. there was only one other table in the restaurant, when they were seated they were offered a sea bass special, we were not, i believe they were training a new wait and letting me be the guinea pig, the other guests had impeccable service, to the point they were really annoying me. our wait did not take our empty plates, didn't offer us a special, and didn't know the menu very well. i can see this place really struggling when they are busy. order the meat stuff, i over heard a regular say that is what they do best, and from my experience i would have to agree. it is byob, we had an open bottle of syrah we dragged in, i would not recomend a good red for this trip, the spices will confuse your palate, stick with a european lager or a crisp white for this meal, good wine will get lost in translation.",

    "well last night i went to cafe orchid for the second time. my first time was not the best experience, but last night was definitely a lot better. i am a vegetarian who eats fish (pesco veg to be more exact), but if you serve me a fish with fins and head, i have a very hard time eating it because. . . . . .well it's like looking at me and is like, why are you doing this to me?!?!?! anywho, when i went the first time i ordered this bass dish that is a regular on the menu. it was basically baked (i believe) and had mozz melted all over it and i am a keen lover of the cheese. anywho, as it is usually served with bass, they usually give you the entire thing, so i specifically asked the waitress wil this be served whole?! she said no. one of the things that is cool, but also results in sometimes. . . . . .miscommunication, most of the wait staff are foreign. well needless to say my fish came with head and fins and i just stared. very luckily, my very nice friend took it apart for me and hid the parts behind his little lettuce portion. i had some issues eating it still, but luckily i had consumed enough wine that i was able to choke it down =) so last night the very nice man that i am seeing suggested this as the place to go. i'm always willing to give places a second go i did with ethiopian the other night and that wound up fantastic. everything deserves a second chance. so i willingly said yes. we brought, well he brough white wine and went. it was rainy but since the summer seems to be dwindling here in chicago and i hadn't the last time we were there, we ate outside and it was perfect. i didn't realize it, but i guess ezme is a regular mid eastern app. so we got that, but it was much spicier than i had had at efe's. it wasn't bad, but i'm just not a real spicey kinda gal, so i actually preferred efe's to cafe orchid's. as well, i guess maybe it isn't that odd to serve bread rather than pita at a mid eastern restaurant because cafe orchid did too. i prefer the pita, but the bread is good too. to cool off from the ezme we got baba ganoj, which was absoolutely delicious! everybody always goes with the hommus, but honestly i sorta like the baba ganoj better it has more flavor i suppose. so for the entree i was going to go with this eggplant dish because i was a little weary about ordering a fish dish again; however, the waitress was really pushing this sea bass special on me. it's grilled and cooked with dill. she said it could be de boned, which i also secretly was like, uh. . . . . yeah, that's what they said last time. so i took the risk and ordered it! it was absolutely fabulous. there were still some little bones it in, but it was phenomenal. it came with the white rice that i believe is cooked with coconut and a salad. the man i was with =) had gotten this yogurt sauce with his lamb chops and i was using that to dip as well and it was just absolutely delicious. as always i had to get dessert. she recommended this like flan/custard, chocolate/cinnamon topped thing, and it was delicious. i split it with my man friend =) and i probably coulda eaten one all by myself as it was delicious. i'm a lover of the chocolate, but this still managed to the trick; however, i was also at the end of 2 bottles of wine. oh yes, it's also byob which is always fabulous. totally recommend cafe orchid. it's sorta out there, but luckily it's just off the brown line addison stop, so if you can take public transit, you're good to go, otherwise cab is fabulous! falafel!",

    "i would not be lying if i say i became a yelp member to bless this place with the 5 stars it deserves deep from my heart and stomach! i am originally from turkey and tried all the turkish restaurants in the city and finally found happiness in this cute little restaurant. i met the chef and the owner thanks to my yet unforgotten turkish and i should say he is amazingly friendly apart from being a great chef, same for the waiters and waitresses! i was skeptical about the success of this place in chicago since it is a little more traditional compared to turquoise, for example, which has a more diverse menu and better furniture! i was happy to be wrong though as it is packed whenever i go there these days, so reservation is a must starting from thursday! i kind of feel bad that my hidded spot is all discovered now but the quality and price have not changed at all plus everything feels better when shared! i want to list some of my favorites because i cannot hold myself from commenting on what next table orders when i go to orchid and most of the time the comments are not nice! i dont understand why someone would go to a turkish restaurant to order sword fish! so here are my picks: sardines stuffed in grape leaves (ask your server not to overcook it so that the smoke does not kill the sardine flavor) liver all eggplant dishes (at any turkish restaurant) lentil soup grilled sea bass (if you are not grossed out by the head that comes with the fish, it is as good as the ones that are freshly caught from the bosphorus! can be overcooked sometimes so warn you server) lamb kebab adana kebab (ask for bulgur rice) spinach with yougurt if you like turkish food, this is really the place to try! and if you ever get disturbed by the loudly laughing crowd diving into possibly everything that can be ordered on the next table, dont hesitate to say hi and tell me to shut up, i will not be offended at all!",

    "2.5 stars. i really, really wanted to like this place since it is a byob with reasonable prices and a nice covered patio. we went there on a spontaneous dinner date. not having any cravings for any type of food in particular or any idea on where to go. drove by cafe orchid, and made a quick decision! unfortunately, since it was so spontaneous we did not have any alcohol with us. maybe that would have made the experience better. we got to sit in the outdoor patio, which was covered but still had the outdoor breeze coming in. i did notice that the patio furniture was a little mismatched, having metal chairs with cushions on some tables and plain folding chairs on others. odd, but not a huge deal. i also did notice that my water cup, which was turned upside down when i sat down, was all dusty on the bottom. not sanitary, but not enough so to drive me away. now let's get to the food. appetizer: falafel. i hate to compare, but i rarely ever eat falafels except from sultan's market. and, man. is sultan's market's falafel way better! cafe orchid's falafel was way too fried, which made it hard and it was also kind of flavorless. granted, the hummus that we dipped it in was good. but i felt like it could have had a little salt or garlic or something. for my entree, i got the beef kabob. it was a skewer of beef over rice with a salad on the side. the portion was perfect! i almost finished the whole thing. although i probably shouldn't have. the beef was flavorful and tasty, but i had to compare it to my favorite kabob place: noon o'kabob. cafe orchid is more of a turkish feel so had different seasonings (maybe paprika?) but overall the noon o'kabob's beef was so much more tender and flavorful. i would rather spend a little more and drive a little further to go there. now, onto the service. it sucked. we felt like we were waiting forever for our food. both the appetizer and the entrees. we were kind of in a rush and wanted to go in and out but we ended up being there for probably 1.5 hours. we even asked for the check and the waiter nodded, but then proceeded to serve another table and then wait on another table first. we then asked someone else to get the check and then our waiter brought it over. i am not that picky about service but when it is bad, i don't like it. this experience was really a mediocre one. i do not need to go back when there are other restaurants with a similar style of food but with better quality and service. too bad it is a byob. i tend to love those.",

    "this place is so close to everywhere i've lived for the past, oh, 15 years or so, yet this was my first time stopping in. the space was much nicer than i had anticipated, after years of drive bys i had always assumed it was a sort of seedy joint, and i am glad to be proven wrong. the outdoor patio was full so we sat inside in a corner table adorned with cushions. the byob/no corkage fee is a definite plus (now if only tjs down the street had refrigerated booze!). we were given bottle openers and an ice bucket. service was very welcoming and pleasant, but sloooooooow as molasses. it was pretty crowded, however, and we were in no hurry so it wasn't a problem on this visit. we went with one shared appetizer (hummus not the best i've had but pretty darn good, with soft bread slices) and separate entrees. i had the chicken shish, which was a skewer of nicely spiced cubes atop basmati rice and a small salad. it was hot and tasty, and nicely portioned. next time i'll opt for an appetizer bonanza instead of an entree everything on the menu sounded good and was priced low enough that one could order several of them to try and not break the bank. overall it was a very good experience, and i'm glad to have finally stopped in.",

    "i have been here once and plan to go again. i went with my mom for our mother day dinner since she was in town and i have been wanting to try this place since it is on my way to work. we went a little early and thank god because they were all booked up with reservations for 6 but we got there at 5. they said if we could eat in an hour then we could stay. it sounds harsh but they were super nice about it. this place is byob which is very happy and both my mom and i love to share so we shared an appetizer and the vegetarian plate. the food was delicious and the service was fast and very very nice. the atmosphere was interesting because it is a mixture of restaurant inside, outside, patio like, you can see some of the kitchen, etc. but it made it more homey to me. had a great time and plan on coming back when it is not the weekend/mother's day :)",

    "first of all the food here is solid. if you have never tried turkish food, this is a great place to start. the grape leaves and hummas are standard fare but so fresh and delicious. everything i have ever ordered has been plain ol' yummy. but the standout dishes must have recommendations are their dresserts. the kazandibi (which is somewhere between flan and creme brulee) is to die for and i have never in my life had baklava this they make it here. it's crazy good. the service is a bit lacking and not very attentive. it's a byob, so we brought a bottle of wine and a big bottle of beer to split. the server opened the bottle of beer instead of putting it on ice like we asked, which is not a big deal but sort of annoying when it was warm and open, sitting in front of us. all in all it's a nice place with above average fare:)",

    "this was the latest pick for my dinner club. its on a corner that you pass by but never realize there is a restaurant there. such a great find though. we were seated in the covered outdoor area. it was a gorgeous night so it was perfect to be seated outside. its a busy corner traffic wise so i was worried it might be noisy but it wasn't at all. in fact there was just the right amount of noise, not to quiet where you felt like the table next to you was in on your conversation, but not to loud that it was distracting. we started out with the stuffed grape leaves, hummus, and falafel as appetizers. as many others have said, the stuffed grape leaves were amazing. the hummus was so so, kind of bland to be honest. and the falafel was pretty good as well, not as good as a couple of other places i've been, but definitely worthy of getting again. i had the sea bass special and was a little disappointed. i thought it could have used a little more seasoning. and to be honest i don't love when fish is served whole and i have to eat it with the head staring at me and pick out the bones. that's just me though, not a knock on the restaurant. the bulgar was really good though, i ate a huge helping. i would have probably been happy just getting the grape leaves and a bulgar! two of my dinner companions loved their meals, one was chicken and the other beef. i wish i could remember exactly what htey were but they both said they were fantastic. and the fourth in our group got the turkish ravioli. she said it was good but she ordered it in the butter sauce instead of tomato sauce and said it was just too rich. we did split a piece of the baklava for dessert and i agree with other yelpers, it was fabulous. even if you are stuffed after dinner like we were, just get it and have a bite or two. so worth it. i will definitely be making my way back to this place. on a warm summer night it is a great spot to have a relaxing dinner outside. and of course, the byob doesn't hurt one bit!",

    "you know when people say things like, this should really be 2.5 stars, or some such stuff and you think, oh, get over it, the future of the world does not depend on a measly half star? i usually think that. and yet.this place really should have 2.5 stars. i've decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. the food was good, if a little oily. the tea was delicious and the baklava was amazing; flaky, honeyed, crunchy bits of pistachios. by far, the most distracting thing about this place is the service. it is s l o w. oh, my god, it's slow. i'm between acknowledging its slowness as a cultural thing or just bad service, but generally if you're getting bad service, you at least have the sense that the servers know they're slow and just don't care, or they know and they're apologetic; none such vibe here. this is apparently how it's supposed to be done at this place. we were promptly sat directly inside the door (cold). fifteen minutes went by before the server came to take our order. the food came out in good time, but we had to ask for our drinks (iced tea and hot tea, respectively) after the food came, and the guy acted all weird, like that was so out of the ordinary to have our drinks with our meal. after our plates were cleared, we sat another 15 minutes before our server came out and we asked for the check, which took another 10 minutes to bring out. so, if i were living in the area, i would most likely get take out over dining in. i won't be hurrying back here, but my dining companion said his previous experience there was good and he works closeby, so he probably will. shrug",

(he thinks this place has the best turkish food in the city.) i loved the atmosphere reminiscent of a european restaurant (although the view of dunkin robbins sort of ruins that). we sat in a covered outdoor area and it was very relaxing the sort of place you end up staying at for longer than you had intended. service was great no complaints. i'd recommend reservations on weekends. we started with a few appetizers and also had some honeydew and feta cheese which seems like a strange combination but was oddly addicting. the orchid special appetizer sardine stuffed grape leaves was great. i had a beef ka bob which i liked. my friend had this huge fish sea bass that was actually delicious even though it came with the head still attached. it's imported from greece i think and usually not on the menu you have to ask for it. definitely a great place to go for anyone in the mood for turkish food.",

    "i ordered takeout from cafe orchid last friday and give it a solid 3 stars. cafe orchid is near mr. man's house, and i'd been meaning to try it for ages. usually mr. man is not very excited about my constant need to try every place within the chicago city limits. however, since he got on his kefta kick, he has been more than willing to try any middle eastern or mediterranean place i suggest! when i arrived to pick up my order, the restaurant was packed! i was very surprised to see how popular this place is! i'd be sure to make a reservation if i ever come back to eat in. we ordered the hummus as an appetizer. it was a very generous portion, and came with pitas. it was very good nice and smooth but not my favorite hummus in the city. mr. man of course had a kefta sandwich, which he said was good, but he likes the one from salaam better. i ordered a falafel sandwich (my barometer for middle eastern food) and it was ok. the falafels were a bit salty. i wanted the yogurt sauce to be awesome, but i thought it was very watery and bland. in addition to the yogurt sauce, we also got hot sauce, which was definitely spicy! the sandwiches also came with a side of fries, which were totally unremarkable. i ordered the sandwiches with pita, but next time i would like to try the lavosh. i was so completely ravenous by the time i got home with the food, i totally forgot to take food pics! sorry! i actually tried to call for delivery once a few months ago, but i think it may have been too close to closing time, because they said they couldn't do it. so if you don't feel like leaving the house, make sure to double check that they are still delivering before getting your heart set on some turkish food! i would come back to try something more traditionally turkish. the prices were great our entire meal was 17! as far as falafel or kefta goes, i think i would stick with semiramis or salaam.",

    "baklava, baklava, baklava, baklava. my god, if you don't eat anything else in this restaurant, you have to try their baklava. i have never had a pastry this good ever. it is so damn good. just try it. you can get two pieces for 4. i really am kicking myself for not coming to this restaurant soon, as i live right down the street from it (within walking distance), but i'm glad i did. on a first glance, it really just looks like some small little shack, and if you were judging a book by its cover, you would give it a 1 star. but let me tell you, they do an excellent job. i walked into this cramped quarters on friday, and was a little stressed out, but they were really friendly and helpful (because i didn't know what to order). i ordered the lamb, and was blown away by the excellent taste. actually, i think im going to go here right now to get the lunch special. i highly suggest going here and eating their food. you will not regret it. now i have to go eat.",

    "i liked this place, more than i expected to. it's in a random location and looks to be very much like a hole in the wall, but it's actually quite cozy inside. i went with a group of 5 and they were very accommodating to our loud conversation, that only got louder with multiple bottles of wine (it's byob). the staff was really nice and attentive, and things were reasonably priced. i tried a bunch of different things and here are a few comments: hummus is awesome and really smooth the skewered mussels were delicious, but are definitely very fried.so kind of heavy stuffed grape leaves were way too soaked in oil, i could barely eat one the falafel was great, especially dipped in the hummus and yogurt sauce the kebob plates (lamb, chicken, and beef) come in almost a skillet covered with yogurt sauce and have some weird/not good mushy bread with them.but other than that they are yummy",

    "i walked by this place many times for over a year before trying it. the restaurant just doesn't have great curb appeal; it looks as though they took over the space from a hot dog stand. i had been told the food was amazing so i eventually tried it and am very happy that i did. they have very reasonable lunch specials. i have tried the donner (gyro) sandwich on lavash bread a few times. the sandwiches can also come on pita bread but the lavash bread along with the addition of lettuce sets this sandwich apart from other gyros. the appetizer sampler is really nice if you can't decide on one or two. i tried to it so i could test more of their menu in one sitting. watch out for the ezme! i really like hot foods but this was a little hotter than comfortable. i also tried the green bean lunch special last week. the green beans weren't quite what i was expecting but that in no way made it bad. it was a sautee of several vegetables and spices and came with a side of bulgur. it was enough for two really delicious meals. i have only had carry out and delivery but am looking forward to visiting this place for a sit down dinner with friends soon.",

    "great service, good value, and decent food. came here for a birthday celebration, bringing along 2 bottles of wine for 6 ppl. our waiter was very nice, patiently explained questions on the menu, and then took our appetizer orders while we decided on our entrees. the appetizer sampler and the falafel were both really good, though some of the dips in the sampler were quite spicy. hummus was super fine and there was not too much filler in the falafel. the entrees were good, but not amazing. i got the orchid's favorite grilled drumsticks brushed with olive oil and lemon. though it had a nice smoky flavour, i couldn't really detect a lemon taste, and i needed to use the yogurt sauce to make it more juicy. i enjoyed the side of bulgar (cracked wheat with some sweet peppers) that came with my chicken. my friends like their entrees as well, but no one was blown away. we surprised the birthday girl with a dessert sampler. there were quite a few things on the dish, but nothing stood out except for the baklava it was flaky, sweet, and super buttery. awesome! i advise against coming in the winter unless you specify indoor seating when you make your reservation. otherwise, you might be stuck in the covered tent like area outside. though they had space warmers, the people sitting in those areas had to keep their coats on. had a great time overall. would definitely come here again.",

    "i've gone past here quite a bit since it's right on addison by the brown line, but never gone in, and i have to admit up front that i'm already pretty loyal to cousins for my turkish food. however, given the good reviews here, we figured we'd give it a try. we ordered hummus and two of their homemade specials: uskadar (my order), which was lamb cubes sauteed with peppers, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms, wrapped in sliced eggplant manti, turkish ravioli, which was described as fresh ravioli, stuffed with ground lamb and served with homemade garlic yogurt and butter it came with a small container of rice (basmati, i think) and sesame bread. it came fairly quickly and everything was correct in the order. they didn't include any utensils or napkins, which was fine since we were at my place, but could be a problem if you ordered for lunch. the hummus was okay, nothing spectacular but good; it came with some cucumber and tomato slices tucked along the sides. my uskadar was really good, although watery, probably from condensation during delivery. the lamb was cooked really perfectly; tender and flavorful. the manti was. not exactly what we were expecting. the ravioli themselves looked more like gnocchi or pelmeni, little dumplings. when you fished them out of the tons of sauce they were covered in. the garlic yogurt tasted a lot like sour cream. it was interesting. not necessarily in a good way, but definitely unique. i have tried the manti at cousins and don't remember it being anything like that. overall, we decided that since we hadn't ordered the kebabs, which would be more familiar and we'd have a better comparison to, we should give it another try sometime. next year, maybe.",

(you know it's good when everyone actually is speaking turkish!) overall, cafe orchid is the best turkish food i've found in chicago. i haven't had falafel or kebobs this good since i studied abroad in europe. absolutely delicious. :) also, the baklavah is to die for perfect in every way. enjoy!",

    "so good, so fresh. those turks know a thing or two about using olive oil and lemon. this is now one of my favorite restaurants in chicago. the menu has a lot of items that you will commonly see at generic middle eastern spots (hummus, falafel, kebobs) but with a fresh and distinctive flavor. those who love eggplant will be in heaven with the marinated eggplant salad (my favorite dish on the menu) and moussaka which in turkey is served as a sauteed melange of eggplant and tomato, unlike the layered and baked greek version. those who don't usually dig on aubergines may seriously reconsider when at cafe orchid. when i go i generally split multiple appetizers and sometimes an entree, along with the sliced loaves of breads that are brought to the table, warm and with a saltiness that hits the spot . so for me it ends up being a small plates experience, without the pretension. the lentil soup is pureed to a velvety consistency, sans rice, and has a distinctive herbal accent (marjoram.still trying to figure that out?). the ezme, a combination of roasted peppers, onion, tomatoes, garlic, parsley and walnut, challenges the concept of salad as glorified lettuce. be warned this is some spicy stuff, so i recommend mixing it with some jajik, plain yogurt with dill and cucumber. i mostly stick vegetarian here but have tried the sardines wrapped in grape leaves which were delicious (and rare to find fresh) and a few bites of a lamb dish not sure which one, which was well prepared but a little fatty for me. the hummus, falafel, and bulgur were also great. in the warmer months there is cute patio space. inside, the dining area is small, just about 6 or 7 tables. it's a wee bit dark but nonetheless inviting, and the servers are very friendly. all in all, a delicious and cozy experience that will please vegetarians, carninvores, and healthy hedonists!",

    "we stopped in hoping to pick up a falafel sandwich and gyros but we learned: a) they only serve gyros for lunch (and if they have leftovers on the spit, they will continue serving until evening.) b) they normally change the oil around 9pm at night so you will have to wait for falafel (or anything fried) i didn't/should have asked do they fry the vegetarian falafel in the same oil as their meat appetizers (i only saw one fry basket)? we decided since it was so late that we'd just share an appetizer platter that consisted of hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, lentil fingers and a spicy pepper dish all cold appetizers served with homemade turkish bread (delicious). all of it was good. the baby ganoush and tabouli were standouts for me. the tabouli wasn't so doused in oils as most others i've had that i was able to enjoy the fresh and crisp parsley. the lentil fingers resembled lentil mashed potatoes molded into links. we will probably be back to try more. it seems like a hole in the wall type of restaurant but the prices are actually higher than that.",

    "love this place! the food is great with a huge menu! i had the lamb once and it was good, but i'm not a big fan of lamb. the chicken kabobs are awesome as well as the vegetarian dishes! we've never been there when the owner hasn't sent out tea and a little dessert as well which adds a great touch! it's a cute place, nothing real fancy, but after a few glasses of wine that you brought it really doesn't matter!",

    "i ordered carry out, so i can't comment on service at the restaurant. my order was ready when they said it would be, and the charges were correct. when i got home, i sampled all of the side items before eating my entree, doner kebob. based on the sides a small salad, seasoned rice, and bread i didn't understand why cafe orchid has received raves from so many sources (yelp, the reader, time out chicago). each was decent the salad fresh (albeit simple) and flavorful but i found the bread average and no sides outstanding. then i tried the doner kebob, and my world changed. this doner (lamb shavings that cafe orchid describes aptly as the turkish version of gyros) had it all: the garlic and seasonings exploded in my mouth, the meat was crispy on the edges and tender in the middle. i love gyros, yet i can't recall ever having enjoyed gyros this much. i didn't tire of them as i kept eating; in fact, although their entree included a tremendous amount of food, i nearly ate it all right there, against my better judgment. each bite was as good as the last. i did save a little bit of the doner for the next night, and it didn't lose a thing in refrigeration: it rated among the best leftover dishes i've had this year. overall, i'd want to try more dishes at cafe orchid to give a more thorough review, but my experience with the doner will keep me coming back. also, i thought when ordering that the price was high for a corner kebob place, but considering how much food they gave me (and how fantastic the doner was), i think the price (about 13 for the dinner entree portion) is reasonable.",

    "well, it looks as if the place doesn't need more positive reviews, but on my first visit there, it certainly needed more customers. doug and i stopped there on a memorial day weekend walk, and we were the only customers at lunch. i hope they do a brisk takeout business, and judging from the other reviews here, that is probably the case. while the atmosphere is not much to write home about, the food and service were fantastic. the staff was very friendly (got to know them by name with no other customers there.) we had several appetizers. the dolmas or stuffed grape leaves were the best i have ever had. the sauteed spinach with the white sauce was delicious and offered a nice complexity of flavors and textures. the skewered mussels were kind of a surprise, since i associate skewered with kebabs. these mussels arrived deep fried on a salad plate with a nicely spicy hummous type dipping sauce. there was a generous amount, unlike the dolmas. doug and i both would have preferred that the plate of fried mussels, which were really good, had maybe four pieces, and the dolma plate had eight. it was the opposite. the turkish bread which accompanied everything was nicely chewy and fresh. we also opted for a plate of doner meat (gyros) on a bed of hummous. that did the trick in filling us up. the staff treated us to aromatic and piping hot little glasses of turkish tea after our meal. a nice gracious touch, i thought. i would like to go back for dinner, or try the dinner items for takeout or delivery. the dinner menu is much more extensive. the place is also byob, with i believe no corkage fee. so, all around and delicious experience for the palate and a good value for the pocket book.",

    "despite not being a chicago local, i feel compelled to yelp lao sze chuan and share my story below. this restaurant was already on my radar before coming on a week trip to the city. i had seen it on anthony bourdain's travel show, and one of my chinese students ate here recently and recommended it. we decided to order take out from the chinatown location because 1. prices are a little cheaper than the flagship on michigan ave and 2. the chinatown menu is bigger. also, delivery was available to our address. so, funny story. they day we're planning to order take out, my husband and i are sitting in the food court of the north bridge shops, eating salads at a table just outside yet another location of the restaurant inside the mall. a man came out talking with a woman, and i overheard her call him tony. now, i've been scrolling the menu online already that day and had seen a bunch of tony's special dishes listed. i decide to be bold and interrupt, asking if he was the tony? indeed, it was the owner/chef himself. he was so nice and spent time talking to us about the menu when we told him we were getting food that night. he answered my questions about the differences between a couple chicken dishes and some eggplant options (they got, like, 8 eggplant dishes which is pretty serious). tony says, a lot of people have garlic eggplant, but i'm the only one who makes spicy eggplant with ground pork. onto the food: we ordered the signature dry spice chicken. i was hesitant to order this dish because i had it previously at a well regarded restaurant in sf chinatown, and it was dry, bland, and consisted mostly of the peppers themselves (so many that we took a picture of all that were left after we ate the chicken). tony's version was amazing. really spicy, great sauce, moist chicken. (i loved it so much i actually sucked on some of the peppers themselves. warning: you might want to consider this is not going to be the best idea later on, but i still say it was worth it.) we got the eggplant with pork. how could we not? which was also fantastic. i also recommend the szechuan wontons, and we rounded out the meal with peapod sprouts (i always love those). in short, a great szechuan chinese experience. last thing we talked about with tony. he is thinking of opening a restaurant in cambridge (ma). please, please open a restaurant in the boston area. we will eat there all the time! chicago, you guys are lucky.",

    "this is probably one of my favorite places in chinatown. i've been coming here with my family since i have been young and the taste has not changed one bit. came here a couple days ago with my boyfriend and ordered the twice cooked pork and the crispy lemon shrimp. since we're regulars here, we ordered as soon as we sat down. the pork is always cooked to a nice crisp and juicy taste, soaking up all of the sauce. the shrimp is nice and crispy and just melts in your mouth. you really can't go wrong ordering twice cooked pork and crispy lemon shrimp here. the staff is always super friendly and will provide whatever you ask. they aren't always the most attentive, but who goes to chinatown for good service? all you have to do is ask and you'll get it. they do charge a dollar or two per rice that you ask, but you get unlimited refills so that's a plus. by the time we asked for the check, the server asked, leaving already? to our surprise it had only been 20 minutes since we had gotten there and spent time eating. i can attest that the food does come out and an unbelievably fast rate and they are not there to waste your time. not a fast food restaurant but the food comes out just as fast. definitely would recommend coming to this place and checking it out. they do have multiple locations outside of chinatown, but i do feel that the chinatown location does have the best taste and portion size of all the other chicago locations that i've been to.",

    "this was probably one of the worst places i've been to. actually probably the worst. go spend your money elsewhere. we came in around 9pm. they told us to sit in a temporary table while we wait for another table to clear up when the restaurant was pretty much all open. they were trying to get the other people to leave by clearing up their table but that made us feel very uncomfortable. we just sat there confused as to why they couldn't sit as somewhere permanently. we had to ask ourselves to sit somewhere else. this was already our cue to leave but unfortunately we didn't. we ordered the ayce hot pot which was 18.95 per person. it's on the last page which was another hint that we shouldn't have got it. the broth was super plain. the dipping sauce was store bought. the seafood was frozen and looked rotten. the meat looked okay but the meat was hard to chew. the dude didn't even give us a bowl and spoon until we asked. he wasn't good at english, which was understandable, but it was more of the fact that he didn't know what was available. honestly i didn't want to eat anymore because the food was just sad. everything that could go wrong went wrong. the waiters were nice but they didn't know what was happening. to even put some more salt on our wounds, they included around ~18% gratuity with a table of 5. wish there were more heads up to this. my heart is crying. i love supporting small businesses, very tolerant of places, but this place spells no all across.",

    "this is probably one of my new favorite chinese restaurants. even before you walk in, there are many articles, pictures, and publications posted on the windows showing its notoriety. me and my fiancee headed down to chinatown to check out the annual summer fair and before we embarked to hit the fair we decided to grab some lunch. when we walked in it wasn't very full. there were a couple of empty tables and no line to be seated, but the wait staff was still hustling and bustling. we were seated promptly and given hot tea and a mildly spicy pickled cabbage for the table. the tea had a great tea flavor with a little sweetness and the cabbage was spicy and savory. we ordered the house special dry chili prawns and the mongolian beef tenderloin. both dishes were delicious! the prawns were coated with a crispy and crunchy batter and were covered in dry red chilies. although the chillies were piled on, the spice level was not through he roof. there was a good balance of savory and saltiness with a good kick of spice. it wasn't so spicy that you had to drink water after every bite . the mongolian beef is probably one of the best i ever had. good quality and fresh ingredients and you can tell it was cooked fresh to order. the vegetables were still a little crunchy and the sauce was amazing and coated everything and not just drenched. usual chinese food is pretty greasy and heavy but the preparation was light and didn't weigh you down.unless you couldn't stop eating cause it was so good. we highly recommend this place and i can't wait wait to go back just to try the other dishes. happy eating!",

    "i was in china a year or so ago. specifically in chengdu where sze chuan food is served primarily. i came here with my friend and had the twice cooked pork. he had the yu shiang pork (fish taste sauce pork). both were great dishes. i'd personally would have my friends dish over the twice cooked pork but that's my preference. staff was nice, atmosphere was calm and welcoming, and the overal portion sizes were adaquate for the amount being paid. i had left overs as well as my friend. it was quality food at a good price. though, this isn't a 1:1 for the food in china because they don't overdo the sze chuan pepper spice a good thing since most people here wouldn't be able to stand the high spiciness of the pepper, the food still tastes great. edit i realized what i ordered was a mild version of the dish. there is a spicier version which has more of the sze chuan pepper integrated within the dish.",

    "i waited a full week to see if my initial feelings would soften with this restaurant.it didn't, and this will be my first, and hopefully last, bad yelp review. everyone has a bad day but even if that were the case here, there is more than enough to critique unfavorably with lao sze chuan. my issues are mainly the service and the unauthentic sichuan cuisine. service: it changed from acceptable to non existent and unexplanably testy. when we ask why it was taking long between the first to last dish (25 minutes) the wait staff became rude and ignored us. customers coming in after we asked were served before our last three dishes arrived. they treated us like lepers. unacceptable! unprofessional! food: we ordered six entrees and all were average at best, a couple unacceptable. i will comment on three in particular: 1) spicy governor's chicken (menu item 561) not authentic sichuan! had no chinese vegetables, only baby corn from a can and green bell peppers. the chicken chunks were 75% batter. sauce was gummy and tasteless.just hot from the chili peppers. what a ripoff! 2) stew beef trim flank noodle soup (item 701) soup was spicy from all the hot oil spilled into the bowl. mostly noodles and very little flank meat. the only flavor/taste was hot from the oil, not complex, layered or sophisticated in the least. 3) chef's special dry chili chicken (item 5633) nothing special here unless one likes paying 13.95 for a plate of chili peppers (see pictures on yelp) and some batter fried chicken. this is not authentic sichuan. no flavor, just painfully hot from the copious amount of chilis. this is not a good sichuan chinese restaurant. the food plays off the spicy sichuan nature but its just hot, unsophisticated, unauthentic, american chinese entrees. if you're looking to test your man vs. food machismo, you might consider this (or just buy a bag of dried chilis instead). otherwise, find some other place to spend your hard earned money on enjoyable food.",

    "went to a chinatown restaurant renowned for not for the faint of heart spicy cuisine. the descriptions suggested non stop diarrhea and heartburn, so i high tailed it there. is bullshit one word? because that's the word to describe the claims. i ordered the two of the spiciest dishes there (chili chicken and fried noodle with pork and calamari) and it wasn't even tinley park people spicy. if you don't have to down a whole beer after a few bites to not scream in pain, you don't get to call yourself that spicy. and if you don't even need a glass of water? you're a damn joke. there was no fire to put out whatsoever. so any diarrhea i will experience tonight is the result of nerve damage due to diabetes. here was my fortune: the luck that is ordained for you will be coveted by others the restaurant was filled with rich white people. two kinds: old rich whites who moved back into the city when the nest went empty people who assume their luxury condos make them chicagoans who might boink trustfund kids (the peers of their own children) in bucktown. the other kind were those who still have brats and live in southern lake county. i was seated next to a group of those, nearest a woman with an infant in a stroller. when she saw me she looked at me like a turd that might ooze turd juice onto the little future entitled american she was raising. so she pulled the stroller closer to herself. i suppose it would be spicy for her. right when i made it to my car and lost my parking (no free parking anywhere near the place), i had to pee. the asian walgreens worker at the adjacent.walgreens lied and said the bathroom was out of order. so i went to ricobene's. i stopped to buy a strawberry shake and it was amazing, exactly what i wanted and didn't know i did. i was going to smoke my 2 cigar while i drank it, but it was too good to risk contaminating. now i'm listening to ass ponys in the parking lot and smoking the aforementioned cigar. in about five minutes, i'll put in the magnificent pat hughes and listen to him describe a baseball game that despite the crushing absurdity and disappointment of life i still care about. this is enough. plenty actually.",

(hint: if you go very late at night the cabbage is pretty spicy.) spicy szechuan standbys are the best bit here: the ma po tofu is second to none, full of leeks and tingly with szechuan peppercorns. the potstickers are delicious in an old school large and greasy kind of way. i like the steamed dumplings too, but somehow my companion always wants the potstickers. the spicy crispy items are great if you are prepared to eat deep fried stuff. they come on a plate laden with red peppers. these add flavor, but they don't make the dish too hot; don't eat them. there's nothing fancy about this place; there's white paper on the table and everything feels a little chaotic, in a friendly sort of way. it can get crowded; find the jovial host and make sure you get a number if you need to wait. there is now lots of good szechuan food in chicago, but we do seem to keep coming back here.",

    "if you like spicy food, you will like this place. i'm talking about spicy spicy spicy food. this food is not made for the weak. i love szechuan food. i lived in nyc for 5 years and i was first introduced to szechuan food there and got hooked on it ever since. listen most of their food is made with peppers, chili, etc. it's spicy hot. if you don't like spicy food, don't go. it's as simple as that. if you like sweating, and i'm talking about dripping sweat and if you like your tongue being numb spicy, then this place is for you. just a warning it's not for the weak. i love their dry chili chicken. it's their specialty. can't go wrong with it. i'm also obsessed with their boiled beef in spicy szechuan sauce these days. this dish is going to make you hot spicy hot. it comes out in soup but when you mix it with rice and your tongue is numb from it, and your dripping sweat from your face, you know the dish is good. hahaha i might be crazy. i also get their twice cooked pork and mapo tofu. can't go wrong with that. this food is not for the weak. explore other areas of chinatown. explore meals outside of orange chicken. give it a shot. you might love it like i do, or hate it like my girlfriend does. lol. fyi this place is a lot better and cheaper than their michigan ave location.",

    "it breaks my heart to give only a 2 star review to an establishment that was my favorite spot in this chinatown ~10 years ago. being from around the region, i frequently visit chinatown and over the years have dined at lsc numerous times. the trend is clear, lsc is just relying on its former glory. service is not much different than the other restaurants in the area so let's focus on food. on my last visit, my family and i ordered three dishes (wife and husband platter, twice cooked pork, and spicy pork stew). the wife and husband platter was bland. clearly from a pre made batch that's been sitting there for at least a day. there was no presence of the expected numbing flavors associated with this traditional dish. the twice cooked pork was filled with slices of pure pork fat and drowned in an over salted black bean sauce. the spicy bok choy stew was served with some pork . overall, these dishes are missing the savory spice that made lsc popular years ago. will probably visit in 6 months and hope they can turn this decline around.",

    "while in chicago, my uber driver recommended this restaurant in chinatown, which was right across the street from the hotel where i was staying. ma pao tofu and dry chili chicken were noted as star dishes, so ordered both. while they both were different than other chinese or szechuan dishes i had ever had, the tofu was so spicy (should have expected as much) that i could only eat a few bites. service was not impressive and they charge extra for rice, which seemed a little absurd given the 20+ price tag for each dish, a little higher than your typical asian spot. that being said, it was fun to experience something so authentic in chinatown. probably wouldn't come back or recommend this place to others, but it was still a neat experience.",

    "come hungry or bring a friend! the portions are family style and meant to be shared. my group tried ordering individually, and we had plenty of leftovers. the food is great too. i ordered the dry chili chicken and the boiled chili beef. both were great, but the boiled beef was the clear winner. the beef sits in a sichuan chili broth that brings just the right amount of heat and a nice range of flavor. the beef was cooked well and the vegetables complimented the broth and beef well. it can get kinda spicy so be prepared for that. the chicken was fried well, not too much breading, not too much crunch. even fried and in smaller portions the chicken kept it's natural flavor. this too is served with chili peppers which made the dish that much better. if you are a fan of spicy or savory food that comes in big portions come find this place tucked away in the western corner of chinatown square. my only complaint is that the service for water was slow at the start. they eventually brought our table a pitcher though. would go again.this week.",

    "my wife and i recently visited chicago this past weekend with the intent of trying out a few new restaurants. having enjoyed our last trip to chinatown a few years back, we decided to try another restaurant in that area. we were very pleased with our experience, the food and the service. the hosts name is tommy, he's literally sitting at the very first table greeting everyone who walks through the door and walks then to their tables. the wait staff was so eager to serve us that they were fighting at the table over who was going to take our orders. taking each other's pens so the other couldn't write, it was quite comical. needless to say we had multiple people helping us through the entire meal. we ordered crab rangoons, chicken fried rice and fried pan noodles (pretty sure that was the name). everything was quite tasty with the exception of the chicken fried rice. just didn't quite taste what you think it should've tasted like. my wife ended up pretty much splitting my fried pan noodles with me. although the 1 food dish wasn't perfect, i cannot say we didn't have a 5 star experience. it's definitely worth a visit.",

    "my parents and i frequent lao sze chuan whenever we need a ma la spice fix. while they go heavy on the chili oil and other seasonings, i have never walked away regretting my decision to dine here, even the day before i ran the chicago marathon. in terms of appetizers, anything with a spicy dry rub or a chili oil concoction can do no wrong in my book. i especially enjoy the hot and spicy dry beef, the tripe, and the bamboo shoots. try not to fill up too much on these small plates, as the cold appetizers should only whet your appetite for the delicious entrees to come. i particularly enjoy their steamed fish which sounds boring and bland but is usually full of green onion, ginger, and lemon zest notes. for the antithesis of this dish, try the beef noodle soup (spicy, of course) with pickles. of course, for the vegetarians, i definitely recommend trying the garlic fried spinach as well as the crowd favorite, mapo tofu. these pillars of sze chuan cooking can do no wrong. the entire menu is extensive and wonderful, though i would ask your waiter for the freshest fish in the season. for the frequent yelpers out there, this restaurant does honor check in coupons, albeit they checked mine with the boss before pulling out the requested egg rolls. service has always been prompt and friendly though, full disclosure, we are a mandarin speaking household that orders completely in chinese. seating is family style on long tables with smaller party seating along the sides. there is also a large seating area upstairs (if you ever look into the restaurant and it looks packed, do not fear). overall, i've always had pleasant experiences here. my only regret is ingesting far too much spice for my own good because of the quality of the cooking here. oh, and did i mention the bottomless tea? definitely order the tea to wash down all those hot and spicy bites.",

    "the review depends on which of his restaurants you visit. if you go to the lao szechaun in nordstrom's building then a 4 star meal is in order. been there several times and have had great food. house special hot and sour soup is off the charts spicy and great for chili heads. also the dry chili chicken is exceptional. the problem was after having a couple great lunches we decided to visit the original in chinatown. now if you want authentic chinese hot pot and already understand what that means then head on down, but for the uninitiated hang on too your seats. we ordered the traditional hot pot, if service was better like downtown then we should have been told to stay on the american side of menu. first out came the two side pot one side spicy the other not then out came the tray of items to cook into the broth. the tray included tripe, chicken feet, tofu, stinky tofu, fish ball (their term), pig ball ( not sure if this is ground up or a testicle), shrimp with head on, some type of fish that looked like it had been defrosted on sidewalk out back, muscles that came to table raw and smelly ( not in the fresh sea good way). at this point i felt like they were back in the kitchen laughing at us. well we decide to try the authentic.spicey broth was only option for me other was not good. i like menudo so i tried the tripe, not a good first choice. not sure what fish ball was and maybe i don't want to. my friends kept asking if this was some kind of prank i was playing on them. also when the check came i was told i am no longer allowed to pick the restaurant.",

    "let me start out by saying lao sze chuan is the best chinese restaurant i have ever been to, i have been here multiple multiple times over the years and tons of other chinese restaurants as well but none really could match the flavor of the dishes here, from the dry chili chicken to the mongolian beef, to the szechuan spicy beef everything here is almost perfect taste wise, do yourself a favor if you come here don't order cantonese don't order fried rice or beef chop suey if you want that go to 3 happiness down the street or your local hole in the wall around the corner, this place specializes in spicy dishes get the dry chili chicken this is the best dish here and depending on the chef will set your mouth on fire and make you sweat all worth it, you could ask for dishes less spicy if you're not accustomed to spicy food, szechuan spicy beef is also delicious big old bowl of pepper cabbage and beef so bomb! get the orange beef if you want a cantonese dish this is very very good and not too spicy at all, spring rolls are very good they don't have regular egg rolls here so don't even try it, another good appetizer here are the szechuan dumplings yummy, any spicy dish is good here kung pao, hunan etc. shrimps are big not scampy, never tried the hot pot here looks really good but i don't know why i have never tried it supposed to be a specialty here, now i deduct a star for a reason, the service is horrible, and i mean horrible they don't come back they bring you your dinner before your appetizer, they don't bring you the check they don't give you water unless you ask they don't give you a refill, sometimes they run out of rice, ( run out of rice! ) had a real bad experience here one time when they were down to one chef and it took forever for us to get all our food, i was ready to walk out luckily my family convinced me to stay, but i keep coming back luckily a lot of the staff know us so we tend to get better service than other people but still sometimes it's the same old lao szechuan, still i keep coming back and i'm not the only one this place has been closed down twice reopens every time people know about it and they still pack the place, it's really simple food is so damn good service is so damn bad gets closed down reopens, people come back i come back place is so damn good lol!",

    "nothing like a legit authentic chinese restaurant in a chinatown! the food was fantastic. only one other chinese restaurant that i remember can match this place when it comes to food. we are a group of 7 and we ordered chengdu dumplings, don don noodles, combination pan fried noodles, eggplant with pork, mongolian beef, mongolian lamb, mongolian chicken, and lobster with ginger scallion sauce. everything tasted amazing! the service, however, was a little disappointing. it was a friday night and they were extremely busy, so i can understand to a point. but they didn't check on us very often and while everyone was very polite and friendly when they did check on us, it was just very hard to get their attention when we needed something. and when we would ask for things like more napkins, more tea, or a fork, they seemed to do 10 other things before bringing them to us. most of the staff did not speak english very well, which made communication difficult. there was one gentleman, however, who was very helpful. he seemed to be a manager and took very good care of us. one final thought when we ordered the lobster, we were told it was taking a little longer than everything else because they had to go buy it from the market. extra points for freshness, but minus points for the long wait. it did come while we were still eating, though, so it wasn't a huge deal. i would come back here again if i'm in the area because the food is that delicious! but i will have to make sure i have plenty of time and patience when i do.",

    "this place calls itself the best chinese restaurant in the usa. not so much. definitely not the worst, by any means, but the best? no way. don't get me wrong; we didn't have any major issues with our food. my spicy food loving friend was happy with the spice in the boiled beef. my mongolian tenderloin was nice and tender. my daughter was good with her orange chicken. the spring rolls were fine (used the yelp check in freebie). however, nothing was overly flavorful, blew us away, or was any better than what our local chinese restaurants have to offer back home. the servers seemed overwhelmed and had a difficult time keeping up. one brought a dish out to a couple just as they gave up on it and were about to leave. another group next to us ordered additional food and the server forgot all about it. i wouldn't tell anyone not to go, but don't expect to be amazed.",

    "note: i've been here twice. i can't remember the first time well because i was with a big group and the food was not the center of attention, but i think i was satisfied. this post addresses the second time, when i had a terrible experience. i added an extra star to reflect an average of these two occasions. my family went to this restaurant some time ago and we were quite disappointed. the food was ok to mediocre, but service was extremely poor. i rarely reduce my rating for service unless it is noticeably bad, but this was one of those exceptional cases. i think that because we went during a long weekend, the customer volume was high and the waiters were over worked. one of the guys looked like he already swore to leave the labor force forever once his shift was over. while busy season is not really an excuse for a restaurant to ignore service quality, i did cut them some slack. the first problem was our soup. we got a pickled cabbage soup, but a few minutes later, the waiter came out with a spinach soup, saying that there was no more cabbage soup and proceeded to convince us that there was not much difference between the two anyhow. of course, you don't need to know anything about chinese cuisine to figure out that this persuasion was doomed to fail, and we refused the soup altogether. next we got a braised chicken dish that we never ordered. we got to keep it i always love free food but i had to imagine that some other group was going to become very upset. our snow pea leaves then came and they didn't look right. usually, they are dark green and leafy, but these were light green and consisted purely of stems that were hard to chew. if you search snow pea leaves on google, you'll see pictures of this beautiful, luscious dish, mmmmm. but we were not granted this pleasure. they were nearly inedible (my chinese parents then said something about the ambiguity of the word dou miao (dou miao) that could have caused this discrepancy, but i barely know the language; please don't judge if you speak fluent mandarin). the one other dish we ordered was nothing remarkable, but it was correct. i don't want to write any lies, and so will not try to name the dish. besides that, the second floor seating area (which is more of an annex, for when the first floor area is filled) has no foyer, so every time someone enters the restaurant, you'll be greeted with a blast of air. in the winter, beware. at least ask to sit away from the entrance if possible. it was in the low 30s and blustery when we went, so you can imagine how pleased we were to get that free air conditioning in the wrong season.",

    "i looked forward to this place for an entire week. i knew it would be the night that chicago would get its first anticipated snow for the season and i wanted to share the magical hot pot meal with my friend as it would be his first experience. so many things went wrong. 1. one of the main waitresses seemed like she was purposely ignoring us, even after speaking to her in mandarin. when i told her i was interested in the hot pot, she grabbed the menus from our hands and left. the cool part about hot pot is choosing your ingredients and i was left sitting there really confused, thinking she would come back and ask. instead, she brought out this party snack platter of a random stuff. stuff that i didn't want and don't usually eat in my hot pot. i had to ask for beef and some other meat otherwise i'd just be eating 17 worth of mushrooms and pre packaged fish balls. the other younger waitresses were pleasant but the main waitress was just rude. if you hate your job that much, quit and become a basket weaver or whatever makes your cranky ass happier. 2. i am very, very, very disappointed in the quality. the frozen shrimp was disgusting, fish balls were the cheapest of the variety and the sliced meat seemed to be frozen and the meat tasted old to me. even the dipping sauces were given to you in this huge container that looked like it's been passed around a bit. garlic (not even fresh garlic), chinese bbq sauce and the peanut sauce were the only things that came out. what about cilantro, vinegar, green onions, or anything else? at the end of our meal, one of the employees takes it away the old containers and puts it near the registers which i am 99% it's going to be given to the next hot pot victims. i understand that certain restaurants do this, but it was quickly noticed that quality and cleanliness are not the highest priority for this place. i guess that's why they were given a bad health inspection review. i won't go into details, but it's bad and believe me, i wouldn't have gone if i found it before i went. 3. when we left my friend noticed their back kitchen door was open and a huge crate of our shrimp sitting on the floor unattended. 4. my friend's stomach hurt soon afterwards and i told him that it might be something else until my stomach started hurting a couple of hours later after his. my iron stomach has been through a lot of random eating and never hurts. i've traveled to countries where refrigeration is more of a luxury and never had a stomach issue this bad. the only good thing about the experience was that the ma la (spicy) section had great flavor.",

    "worst experience ever. my companion and i agreed that service, for a lack of a better word, was comptemptuous. we arrived after lunch while the waitstaff enjoyed a meal together in the dining room. after we were pointed to a table, we waited 25 minutes before finally asking if we could have menus. 10 minutes later, a party of two was seated in front of us, shortly thereafter a man behind us. eventually, they inquired about our order, but only after first taking those of the other parties. our server was abrupt and clearly not all that inclined to table service. she cut me off continuously as i placed the order. our food arrived haphazardly the spring rolls were, as previously mentioned, served at room temp. we received our chicken dish at the same time we were served our dim sum. about 10 minutes later we were served our rice and second entree. it was a total cluster. boiled beef i've had it on numerous occasions, but apparently there was some kind of beef shortage on friday because there was little to no protein in the huge bowl of chile gravy it was served in. i placed an order for the spicy cabbage, hoping to pay for a full size portion, not just what they comp every table. no such luck. everything else we ordered was marginal at best. first time ever i noticed that we were unwittingly being charged for rice. had they asked me, i would have gladly ordered and paid for rice, but we weren't afforded the opportunity. additional eye openers: the men's room was, according to reports, swarming with flies. it's right by the kitchen. also, the waitstaff was dutifully filling wonton wrappers from a huge vat of pink material that i've hopefully never put in my mouth. in addition, the server that brought us our check smelled like she'd just taken a bath in a dirty ashtray. this smell lingered and was inescapable. tony, you may want to take a more hands on approach managing the restaurant. nobody seemed to be in charge. the place was almost empty and yet our service was shockingly poor. the food was barely passable. lao is a shell of its former self. it's really too bad.",

    "craving some chinese and ended up here tonight. heard it was one of the better restaurants in chinatown, so we gave it a try. it was good, but def not the best. after we sat down, we waited a while for the waitress to come over and get our orders. when she finally did, trying to get orders in was tough! she hard a really hard time understanding english, which led to just pointing to the number on the menu. (fyi if you don't speak the language and they don't speak yours, joint point to what you want) we had the spring rolls, sizzling rice soup with shrimp, hunan chicken, tenderloin beef with broccoli, and shrimp with pea pods and cabbage. spring rolls were ok. sizzling rice soup didn't have much sizzle to it. literally. and it was a thick texture not the kind of soup i'm used to. wasn't a fan. the shrimp with pea pods and cabbage was boring. but the hunan chicken and the beef with broccoli were really good! def recommend those. after a few bites of the very spicy hunan chicken we realized that we never received waters had to flag down our lady for those.not sure if i'll be back here. i'll try another place next time.",

    "omg they have a sign that says best chinese restaurant in the usa. lol that is furthest from the truth. i ordered soup, veggie fried rice and szechaun chicken. they bought the entree first, then the fried rice 4 mins later and the soup last. i said to my self is that right? when i received the entree it had so much oil, that it looked like a heart attack on a plate. i ordered light sauce and my waiter totally ignored it so i sent the item back. after that the waiter never came back to the table, he sat down with 5 other employees and started eating while the restaurant was full of people. i witnessed one customer get up and go to the back and get his own napkins. i only had one napkin the entire time i was eating, 1 glass of water in a dirty glass. by this time i was done i received the bill from the bus boy, so i took the left over food and gave it to the homeless people on the street in front. i have been going to china town since i was a kid and this by far is the 2nd worst joint in china town. good luck if you choose to eat there.",

    "we entered on sunday around 11 and there weren't too many people around. meanwhile, next door, there were about 40 people standing outside and waiting to get into ming hin. i guess that should have been a sign. firs, the menu is huge; maybe ten pages long. we were given water, a kettle of hot tea, and a plate of kimchi, which was a nice surprise. the kim chi had a good spice on the back and a nice flavor. we ordered six dishes and they all came out within ten minutes, so good job by the kitchen. the veggie spring rolls were fine, nothing special. at least they were crispy. and thanks to checking in on yelp, we got an extra order for free! the mongolian beef was the highlight of the meal. steak, green onion, mushrooms, and onions were stir fried in a garlic and ginger sauce. i would definitely order this again. the dry chili chicken is tremendous, but you better like some spice. it was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, so i was more than pleased. the shrimp fried rice was a very good standard rice dish. we also got a seafood stir fry with shrimp, scallops, and squid. plus, we had a side of szechuan veggies. both dishes had that clear broth, which we really don't care for. the seafood, in particular, tasted like it was steamed or boiled instead of having that nice sear which i really enjoy when i eat chinese food. both those dishes were pretty disappointing. here's the thing. the menu didn't list detailed descriptions of the items. so if you ever go here, make sure you know exactly what you're getting. in baseball terms, this would be a solid double. good in some ways, but could have been better in other areas.",

    "let's run through some chinatown reviews, shall we? first up is lao sze chuan, arguably the cornerstone of chicago's traditional chinatown. it's also the crown jewel of the soon to be defunct tony hu lao empire that seemingly occupies every other square foot of chinatown hu's intent is to sell most of his properties and refocus on the lao sze chuan brand. of course, you're not concerned about all that busy ness, so let's get onto the food. if you like spicy food (and you probably should if you're searching for sichuan cuisine), lao sze chuan is the place for you. your options are not exactly limited to hot and hotter, but most of the best stuff trends that way. nevertheless, i'll present you with a nice menu to give you the non hot optionality. the mapo tofu is a signature dish here, and it's very, very good. it's surprisingly vegetarian, though a ground pork option can be added. for those that haven't had mapo tofu, it's basically tofu in a black bean sauce. lao's is, of course, the traditional sichuan style and heavily doused in the peppercorn chili oil that signifies the regional cuisine. base spiciness of this dish isn't as hot as others (like the forthcoming dish) but still packs a kick for the uninitiated. if you want spicier, try the dry chili chicken. you can't mask the chilis in this dish, since they're cut and intermingled throughout tasty pieces of popcorn fried chicken bits. helpful hint: the chilis aren't there for eating. looking for a a milder chicken dish? the three cups chicken (san bei ji) is for you. rather than using chili oil, this dish focuses on the asian triumvirate of soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil. there's more of a sauce base as well to douse on your rice. also note that the chicken is bone in. it's a nice complement to mapo tofu, in that you can sauce your white rice with both a sweet and a spicy element. finally for some greens, go with the deep fried green beans. lao gives you the option of spicing it up (see the dry chili chicken section) or with the traditional, non spicy version. it's a nice, semi healthy break from the other, rich dishes. contrary to what you might have heard in the news, cockroaches are not on the menu (even if they may be in the kitchen). chalk it up to business as usual in any major city chinatown.",

    "so the ma po tofu at lao sze chan is supposed to be one of the 50 things to eat in chicago before you die. well, it was good, and i'm glad i tried it (thanks, juli!) but not spectacular. the dry rubbed ribs were interesting and different, with lots of what i believe was cumin, but were more like tiny dry rib tips, a little crispy like chicharones, and not worth the price. the complimentary spicy cabbage was nice, sort of like a milder kimchee, and the 2.50 spring rolls we got free with the yelp check in (after the server looked frightened, said she had to ask her manager about, and ran off to do so twice, making us wait in between, but finally brought) were fine but just like panda express, nothing special. but they were cancelled out by the unexpected 2.00 charge for white rice, that we didn't order or expect to be charged for, but which normally comes with any large dish at a chinese restaurant, and which had either some undercooked or overcooked grains of rice in it. this was my second time here, accidentally, and the last time was about equally ok, but with worse service that time. so next time i'll probably go to any of the other 100 chinese places around there, maybe one with a delicious duck hanging in the window. they do have a large selection of what appeared to be authentic (and rather scary) chinese dishes so it's probably a good place to go for that. but i've been to china and the food was pretty awful so no, thanks. you might like it though.",

    "been to lao a few times now. the food is quite good and so we've been back a few times however, it's the service which is hit or miss. our first waitress was quite rude and it seemed that she couldn't care less about our questions. luckily, their waitresses don't seem to be hard aligned to the tables, so we started soliciting a different one that was much more attentive. what we had: eggplant in garlic sauce excellent flavor our favorite entree so far vegetable lo mein really nice noodles chile tofu was this dry tofu that's fried and comes with a ton of dried red chili peppers vegetable hunan nice mixed vegetable dish, with quite a kick i forgot the name, but we had this soup which was very spicy. it was pretty much too spicy to enjoy. we pretty much didn't have much of it. when we mentioned this to the first waitress, she was like, spicy soup deal with it. the second one, again, was much more considerate. she offered to get us another order and make it less spicy. in the end, they didn't charge us for it, so that was much appreciated. i've literally changed my rating in this review 3 times. oscillating between 3 and 4. i'll go with 4, because even though the path was rocky, we eventually got there. i'm almost thinking this would the ideal place to get takeout or delivery that way you cut out the service issues and get to the good stuff.",

    "came here around 1:30 2pm on a weekend, and no line. we had : three spiced chicken, which semi resembled teriyaki chicken bit hit with our friends. chicken was tender, sauce was little sweet and salty. pretty generous portion size. fish in hot pot with spicy oil my friends love spicy food so they finished this up easily. it came with cabbage in the oil as well. if you haven't had this before it is like a small pot with sliced fish and braised cabbage drenched in the hot chili oil. as expected this is hot hot hot (both in temperature and spiciness). eggplant in garlic sauce this is legit my favorite dish of all time. they sauteed it perfectly. it has a nice sweetness to it, and heat. it is mildly spicy. def recommend. steamed soup buns pretty good. these are like tiny buns filled with pork meat and some soup coming from the meat/chives/other veggies in the filling. i felt there are other places with better version but these were okay. nothing too bad, nothing too memorable. chicken fried rice pretty generous with amount of chicken included. my friend got this as his safety dish in case he did not like any entrees. it was average, although i am not sure who can make chicken fried rice that much more spectacular. pork kidney saute this was our adventurous dish. i did not know pork kidney smells but yes it does. the taste is not bad, but for those of you with strong sense of smell, this probably isn't for you. it is sauteed with slices of bamboo shoots and mix of greens. half of us liked it, half of us did not touch it. service was pretty good. ambience is bit peculiar. throughout our meal we were watching a man (who either is manager or owner) with thick gold chains greet customers loudly and guarding the door. overall, i'd recommend the food there. we came with relatives from china before and they feel it is pretty authentic, so i take their word for it. for those who love spicy food, you will leave this place with your mouth numbed in a very good way.",

    "i'm a huge fan of lao sz. i have been going her for a few years now and i've got a consistent menu of things to order just enough that i don't get the same thing every time, but not too many! 1) bon bon chicken this is an appetizer and it's delicious. cold chicken slathered in chili oil and a myriad of other flavors. it's quite spicy to me, but i'm pretty weak when it comes to spice. still, it's not spicy enough that you're too busy fanning your tongue to miss out on the great taste and flavor of the dish! 2) szechuan string beans stir fried, in garlic and meat. not spicy at all but very good and usually not too greasy. appease the guilt of eating fried chinese food and order a veggie :). 3) dry chili chicken the ole standby, of course. it's spicy, it's crispy, it's oily, it's great. 4) szechuan eggplant in garlic sauce a definite favorite. the eggplant is bright purple! it's soft and mushy, but not to the point of being overcooked. a nice, simple, tasty dish. 5) ma po tofu soft, silky tofu swimming around in a spicy red pork broth. something about tofu dishes with meat is super amusing to me. this particular mp tofu is really, really good. the flavors are excellent and it's the perfect comfort food, especially in the winter. 6) sole fish filet with chili bean sauce light, flaky fish, fried and soaked in red, yummy sauce. this is a definite favorite. it's just so good! 7) three chili chicken not my personal favorite, but boyfriend gets it every time. chicken not spicy at all! fried and in a very sweet chili sauce. it's definitely good and sweet, but i'm not big on sweet fried chicken myself. here are my two cents of caution about lao: sz: 1) the delivery food is not good. it's no the timing that's bad, it's that when the food gets to you, the sauces are cold and congealed. i couldn't bring myself to finish the food the two times i ordered delivery, it made me nauseous. 2) the service is pretty wretched. servers aren't nice, it takes forever to get someone's attention (we've sat down at a table before and waited 30 minutes to get greeted by our server!), and it's spicy food with nobody refilling your water! still, i go back often. lao sz, i love you so.",

    "as a new resident of chicago, and a lover of any and all things asian related, i was so excited that lao sze chuan was the restaurant that took my chinatown virginity. i ordered (truthfully way too much food) the pot stickers, lalala chicken pot, and the hostess gave me some complimentary spicy cabbage. this was hands down the best chinese food i have ever had in my life. and that says a lot because i have eaten chinese food, at one time in my life, for 7 days straight. after all these years of thinking i've experienced the best, i hadn't. until now. when the menu says spicy, it means spicy. which almost made me want to hug the chef considering when i go to some thai restaurants and specifically ask for my dish to be extra spicy, i don't even sweat. not at lao sza chuan. my nasal cavity was leaking 1/3 of the way in and i had to stop. i was so depressed, because i wanted to finish, but i couldn't. it was amazing. those pot stickers.superb. moist, savory, just the perfect appetizer. i loved the garlic infusion with the spicy cabbage. it was the first taste when i bit into a few pieces. this too was spicy. the only reason why i simply cannot give the restaurant 5 stars is because ( as most everyone else has said ) the service lacks in comparison to the great food. i had to wave down 3 different people for a straw, to take my order, a refill, the bill, a box. had the service rivaled the food, i would have given lsc a 5 star review. but this food. was heavenly. it tastes much different than what americans expect chinese food to taste like. will definitely return.",

    "my coworker and i went to lao sze chuan for our lunch break today, excited to experience good, quick, service like that of the one in uptown. unfortunately, that wasn't the case: first of all, most of the websites we checked out about lao sze chuan ahead of time said that they opened at 10:30am. we arrived at the restaurant at 10:40am, and the doors were locked, and through the windows it looked like they were still setting up. no problem, we thought, we'll just go ahead and call in our order and wait outside. got our order taken: crispy shrimp in mayo, shrimp fried rice, and pork steamed dumplings. we waited outside and noticed that there were people going in, so about 15 minutes later we decided to go in and check if our food was ready. inside, it was very cold and the floors were newly mopped, so you could already tell that the restaurant on a whole was having a slow start to their day. the wait staff didn't welcome us or anything, so i told the one gentleman who looked like he was in charge of the front room that we were picking up. he said that our food was almost ready. 15 minutes later, still not ready. i chose to pay at this point so that we could leave right when we got the food and still get back to work on time. by the time 35 minutes total had passed, i asked the same guy if our food was ready, and he told us that the dumplings are taking a while. 35 minutes sounds like a lot of time to make dumplings, but yet again, we waited in frustration. meanwhile, the table we were standing by while we were waiting began to get occupied by about 4 workers as they were sitting down for a meal with their aprons on. though i know that this is a trend in most chinatown restaurants, i thought it was a little rude to see staff eating food that was clearly prepared in the kitchen and us having to wait for ours. after about 45 minutes, our food was finally prepared, and at this point we were already late for work. disgruntled, i walk past many lost looking staff members, and then apparently walked past the manager of the restaurant, tommy. he was shocked to see that we had just picked up our food as he knew we were there right when the restaurant opened, and he sincerely apologized. he would have had us come back in to settle the matter, but we were already late for work at this point. he then offered to give us a really good discount the next time we're in don't worry, tommy, if you're reading this, we won't forget!",

    "fun and delicious! there are a lot of mixed reviews for this place, but we really enjoyed our meal! went on a friday night at 8:00, the place was 1/2 full. our server, fawn, was lively and funny, even though her english was better than my chinese! we opted for the following dishes: chengdu dumplings (fab!), peking dumplings (blah), szechwan green beans (yum), dry chili chicken (yum!) and stir fried baby octopus (pass) we were afraid to order the chicken too spicy because we had heard it can blow your ears off we opted for medium spicy, which was perfect. you can order the dishes with your preferred spice level. only issue was the dishes came out all at once; it would have been nice to have one or two at a time. and the overhead lights were too bright! (we took a picture with tommy i think he's the manager he's a hoot! he gave us a round of beers for that cheers, tommy! xie xie thank you!) we'll be back",

    "this place is beautiful inside, cramped when busy but nevertheless it's visually very nice. we went on a midweek evening and they weren't crowded at all which we thought was odd being that this place was very popular (maybe the recent fbi raids scared patrons?) in any event, you would think that when a restaurant is slow service would be much more attentive. way off. the staff was having a dinner for themselves at the biggest table on the main floor! they were loud and obnoxious. we almost opted to change our order to takeout. i was tired and hungry so we stayed and tried to make the best of it. our appetizers took 20 minutes to get to us and the entrees another 45 on top of that. so over an hour to get our meal in a restaurant with maybe 4 other couples. perhaps this was because there was a table of literally 8 employees laughing and carrying on and of course they had their food. if the owner so chooses to respond to this review, i will gladly post the photos. they had one young lady working the floor serving dishes and waiting tables. when the food finally got out to us, shocker, it wasn't even hot. the flavor was there and we both felt that had it not sat around it probably would've been really good. such a shame. there are too many other places in chinatown to eat for us to dine in here again, maybe take out would be the way to go if we ever return. a total waste of 50+",

    "ok first the only 2 slightly wrong things about my experience,1 it took maybe 5 7 minutes after getting menus for the waitress to come to our table, 2 it took a decent amount of time for our food to come out, however after the meal these things do not matter at all. this is easily one of the top meals i've had at a chinese restaurant ever. first they start you off with a complimentary spicy cabbage appetizer which is extremely good, it is drizzled in a red sauce with pepper flakes. for starters we had the potstickers which are hand made and hands down some of the best i've had anywhere, they are tender yet still firm. for our entrees we had the curry chicken which was just great, the vegetables in the dish were insanely fresh, the chicken very tender and the curry sauce the perfect amount of subtle spice. the sesame chicken had huge pieces of chicken which again was really tender. but far and away is the must have dry chile chicken. omg simply put it is the best dish i've ever had at a chinese place. it is also the spiciest meal in a chinese place you'll find. the chicken is crispy the chiles are hot but once it is mixed with the white rice all i can say is wow! this is a must visit of you're in chinatown. definitely one of the best in the city.",

    "lao sze chuan is arguably the most well known of tony hu's restaurants. the dishes are very authentic, and i applaud the restaurant for not holding back on some very unique dishes. however, with such an extensive menu, i'd make sure you think through what you're ordering. the meal starts with a cabbage appetizer that's pretty tasty, yet spicy. i'd definitely try the dry chili chicken, ma po tofu, and fish filet in chili. problem is, you may not want to try all of them at once most things here can get quite spicy. i'd throw in something like yu shiang pork (excellent!) to round it out, as well as a few other less spicy dishes. i've just never come out completely satisfied. perhaps i just haven't found a good balance; i always find my meals here as a little too spicy and way too oily. the fish in particular comes with a shimmering layer of chili oil on the surface. i'd be happy to give lao sze chuan a few more shots; i just wouldn't say it's amazing, or even much better than most of tony's other (less crowded) restaurants in chinatown. service is not good, even for chinatown standards. don't expect much interaction with your servers.",

    "first off, this is apparently where white folks go to eat chinese food in chinatown. that said, the menu is extensive and if you're into less common meat parts, you'll likely find what you're looking for on the menu here. the dry chili chicken was good but the chili to chicken ration was way off (60% inedible chilis to 40% chicken someone is trying to save some money). i actually started laughing when i had to dig through a pile of chilis to get to the damn chicken. my biggest complaint is that the service was horrendous. we sat around and sat around waiting to order. the first two dishes came out in a relatively timely manner but our duck plate never came. finally, i had to ask what was up and our server acted like they'd been back there slaving away over it (they clearly totally forgot about it). it was good, but we also had pretty much finished our meal by the time the duck made its way out (it was about 30 minutes after everything else). i haven't had bad service in chicago before (like i'm really impressed with the restaurant service in this city), but the service here was really pathetic. i don't think i'll go back and will instead check out the plethora of chinatown eating establishments.",

    "this is absolutely my favorite restaurant in chinatown. i am addicted to the dry chili chicken dish. the dish is a plate filled with bite size crispy chicken tossed with szechuan peppers, garlic, ginger, and green onion. the result is a fiery deliciousness that keeps me coming back for more. in addition, the salt and pepper string beans have been another discovered favorite. the service has improved a great deal since i started frequenting this restaurant, but it can be lacking unless you are assertive about your need. don't be shy if you need attention. as of late, it has been consistently good service. because of lao's popularity, getting a table can, at times, be a pain, and the wait in a small entry way can be less than appealing. in visiting with several of the chinese patrons, they informed me the dishes were 95% authentic to what is served in china. i believe it, as each dish i have tried is excellent. parking can be an issue, but most often, with a bit of luck, a spot can be found within walking distance. if you are visiting chicago and love chinese food, this is a must visit restaurant. i recommend it highly. in all probability, i will be there having my favorite dish!",

    "sad to say that this used to be one of my favorite restaurants when it first opened. after the last two disappointments i wont be coming back, nor would i ever recommend this dump to anyone! let me start by saying that the service has never been good, but i let it slide because the food was good. now, it just got ridiculously rude! i brought two friends with me, ( one of them was her birthday).came in on a weekday, so it wasn't busy. a guy asks from across the room how many, then points at a table. after touching the filthy dirty, sticky menus, my friend takes out a baby wipe and sweeps it across the menu to reveal how the wipe turned black from how filthy it was! embarrassed, i asked if she wanted to go else where. she said no because she had already paid for parking and she really wanted to try the food. an older female waiter takes my order first, when i attempted to order several dishes , she would cut me off and not let me finish my order, she would skip to the next person. even after i had to explain that i'm ordering several dishes for all of us, she was in hurry and acted like i was bothering her! it was as if i was ordering too much! she then asked if we wanted steamed rice, i asked if it came with the food. ( it usually does in other places). she said no, its extra so i said no steamed rice thank you, because i had already ordered a shrimp fried rice. so as if to mock me, the first thing they bring is the steamed white rice, then the following six dishes came after. after we ate some of the food, not even 20 min. later the woman comes back asking if we want the food to go. i told the woman that we where waiting for one of the shrimp dishes i ordered. then she rudely asked if we still wanted it. when i was about to say no, a guy came with it. a few mins. later the same woman comes back and starts taking plates full of food and says you want to take home right? getting the hint we say ok. after she comes back with our packed to go food and slams the check on the table, we decided to do coffee and dessert else where. are you kidding me?! so after ordering more than a hundred dollars worth of food, you are just going to practically kick us out for absolutely no reason! it wasn't as if there was people waiting. we are decent, well dressed, polite and not to mention good looking.( maybe she was jealous!) well she missed out on a real good tip, because i usually tip about 30%, not in this case scenario! oh, and one more thing the food was mediocre at best!",

    "my favorite szechuan restaurants in chicago. i've been there for numerous times, so don't expect a whole list about food or i'll die xd. nothing there is totally non authentic. in the u.s. that represents good. you can't expect too much from the opposite site of the world =.= i love the szechuan cold noodles salad si chuan liang mian , one of the best i ever had (including the early 22 years when i'm in china). the dishes with pickle inside are all great. looks like they make szechuan pickle themselves. there're also many other delicious dishes, like ma po tofu ma po dou fu , beef maw and pork blood cake home style mao xie wang , never forget chicken kou shui ji , sliced tender pork with garlic sauce suan ni bai rou , boiled beef in spicy szechuan sauce shui zhu niu rou , and sooooo on. they make the steamed ribs with mashed rice fen zheng pai gu an appetizer, so it's not salty enough to serve rice. twice cooked pork hui guo rou is not spicy and crispy enough, and the garlic leaves and peppers inside don't produce enough flavor. they even put more black bean sauce dou shi than broad bean sauce dou ban jiang inside. won't order it again. dry chili string beans gan bian si ji dou are awful, not crispy at all. some downside. bad service. as bad as the other chinese restaurants. and i'm really confused, as many other comments said, by the spiciness of the dishes. they make some dishes really spicy and some others really mild.",

    "where to begin talking about lao sze chuan! for starters, i go here every weekend. the servers know me. i also order the same things each time i go, which expedites the process. going to a restaurant every week does become (relatively) expensive, but here's three dishes as to why lao is worth it: mapo tofu: the mapo here is fantastic! it's spicy, it's got a lot of tofu, it's warm and oily, it's szechuan. this thrown on fresh rice is my dream dinner. on some days the flavor changes slightly (this last weekend, it was a tiny bit saltier than usual. the weekend before that, it was perfect) but this dish is a consistent winner. i've tried to recreate this flavor at home to utter failure. dry chili chicken: if fresh, the dry chili chicken is crisp, spicy, and rich. basically, it's a bunch of wonderful fried chicken pieces thrown in with a lot of chili and other spices. garlic spinach: spinach in oil and lots of garlic. we started ordering this because we thought ah but we can't not eat vegetables and ended up sticking to it because it's delicious. it complements the other two dishes nicely. i've also tried the green beans and the boiled szechuan beef, which are excellent. some pitfalls: depending on the time of day you arrive (especially during weekend dinnertime), it can be impossible to find parking nearby. this can mean wandering around chinatown for 30 minutes looking for that special person just about to leave as you arrive. this can also mean walking about ten minutes from the parking lot by the train station, which is brutal during chicago winters. also depending on the time of day you arrive, there may be a wait. i've gotten savvy enough that i've never had to wait more than ten minutes. going during lunchtime helps, because crowds gather for dinner. there's a special table nearest to the kitchen area that each time i've sat there i had to wait an hour to get my food. sometimes, their service dwindles. other times, the food comes out so curiously quick you wonder if they defrosted a batch from last week. i've read some articles about lao sze chuan having issues with sanitation standards and also with the fbi raiding this branch, which is slightly alarming?! all in all i love this restaurant and it really does make my weekend. i love the free tea, the spicy cabbage, the not overly friendly attitude of the employees, the inexpensive food. i'd give them 5 stars if not for the service and the sometimes not so fresh food.",

    "extremely disappointed with my first delivery order from here. i ordered off grubhub (might have been my first mistake?) and selected the house special fried noodles and the hot and sour soup. the house special fried noodle dish was described as extremely spicy, which i believe was the only dish labeled as such the dry chili chicken was described as extra spicy, so i thought extremely would be greater than extra. fair logic? anyway, i ordered around 2:30 pm, and my order arrived around 3:30pm, which is pretty standard for chinatown delivery, but i thought i might get lucky and get it sooner since i ordered at an off time. the guy who delivered my order was not unfriendly. bc he didn't really say anything beyond hi when i opened the door and ok when i thanked him. i also didn't get a receipt, but nbd to me since it was an online order. now onto the food. the hot and sour soup arrived fairly warm, but the taste was nothing special for something marked as one of the popular dishes. the fried noodles, however, arrived quite cold and had.dun dun dun.no spice! ugh! i mean it was hilariously underspicy, i've had mild buffalo wings spicier than this. i wasted precious time debating between the dry chili chicken (which i still haven't tried yet) and the noodle dish, but ultimately chose the noodle dish because of the extremely spicy label. grubhub even asked me during checkout how spicy i would like my dish cooked, and i made sure to mark the highest level of spicy. just, :(. the flavor was also rather bland. it reminded me of yakisoba, with the cabbage and noodle texture, which isn't a necessarily a bad thing, but i was expecting something significantly more intense given its description. the online menu also mentioned it had calamari and pork i would suggest a revision to some calamari and pork or even a touch of because that's all there was. perhaps i've been ordering the wrong things here (i ate at the restaurant once before and was impressed, but not overly impressed ordered the ma po tofu and something with wood ear mushrooms that time), or perhaps the grubhub thing just messed with their interpretation of the order. either way, i'm going to try them one more time, order the dry chili chicken for sure (since this dish seems to have received the highest praise here on yelp), and see how my opinion changes. i really want to love this place b/c i love spicy and have been told numerous times this is the place to go for spicy dishes. but this delivery order is really making me question whether i ever will.",

    "best sze chuan chinese food of all time. there's a reason why this guy (owner) has opened up so many restaurants (we're talking 3 locations for lao sze chuan; not to mention lao beijing, lao shanghai and a couple others!) and it's because they make damn good food. yes, the service sucks. but this is one of those places that i look the other way on service because the food is so delicious. also, if you're there on a lucky day, the service works out okay! note: don't eat here if you can't eat spicy. i think it should be obvious, considering there's a sze chuan pepper on their logo, on their walls, on their chairs even! dishes you should try: 1. chef's double cooked dry chili chicken we call this dish crack chicken. they're wonderfully flavorful little crispy bites of chicken that leave you digging for more when they're all gone! 2. double cooked three layered pork basically thin slices of pork belly with green onions in this delicious chili oil. if you save enough to bring home, it makes an amazing sandwich with leftovers. 4. mapo tofu i like that this mapo tofu is truly tofu and doesn't have any meat mixed in for all the vegetarians out there. very spicy dish! 5. hot pot (spicy) all great items! i ate here 1 2x a week in grad school and never got tired of it. i actually even miss it now. the portions are generous and the food is fulfilling. ps: if you pay with cash, you can get a 10% student discount. pps: don't park at walgreens, you'll be towed faster than ever.",

    "i have to update my review of this restaurant, one of my favorite places. i was shocked last night with how incredibly rude and offensive the staff was to my guests. first, the manager an incredibly gruff and pushy man named tommy yells at us outside when our table is ready. we didn't know he was talking to us, so we didn't react right away, and he yelled a sarcastic, hellloooo! not a great start to the evening. then, once we get sat (at one of the many empty tables, which is normally not the case for this place), we are basically ignored for about 15 minutes. while we are ignored, other tables are sat and attended to. every time we wanted some service, we had to stop whatever server was rushing by even just to get some water! the food wasn't as good as it normally is, and even my favorite dish ma po tofu wasn't up to par. i was disappointed. at the end of the meal, my friend picked up the tab, and though i normally wouldn't do this, i supported his decision to forego tipping the staff that had treated us so incredibly poorly. he explained very calmly and politely to the manager, who pushed him about not leaving a tip, and then to the cashier, who pushed him further, and then three times to our main waitress (i say main because we clearly didn't have any assigned server to our table), who even followed my friend back to the table and harassed him about his not liking her service in front of other customers. i was appalled. i will certainly purchase my beloved ma po tofu from here again, but it will be take out only from now on. i can't be responsible for how i'd react if those people ever tried to treat me like how they treated my friends. and tony hu, the owner and unofficial mayor of chicago's chinatown, is such a nice guy with many successful restaurants! but what the heck is happening at this one? i wonder how he would feel if the majority of his clientele were able to sit down in front of him and explain how incredibly rude and offensive his staff is. i hope he becomes aware of it sooner rather than later.",

    "very disappointing, especially for the prices we paid. most dishes are over priced. not worth it, many other better restaurants in the area. we went for lunch recently on a sunday. it wasn't terribly busy, but the service was slow and bad. we were told a dish we ordered was not available but it came out anyways. each dish was mediocre and not as flavorful as expected based on the restaurant's reputation. the vegetable dish was not fresh. i've ordered the same vegetable many times at restaurants in chicago and other cities. never has it looked like what we got the color and taste was off. i guess there's a reason i've only eaten here twice in the 9 years i've lived in chinatown. however the newer location in uptown is decent and has a good lunch special during the week.",

    "because this restaurant had such good reviews, my friends and i decided to try it out last night. but contrary to the reviews, it was an overall horrible experience. from the moment we walked into the door, we realized the hosting was very disorganized; the host was standing outside, not paying attention and smoking. in fact, he continued to smoke after walking into the restaurant, which i consider to be very rude to customers. when we were finally seated, our waiter seemed very annoyed with us from the start and was unacceptably rude. he called over several other waiters in the process, who were likewise unhelpful. the service overall was terrible, and very frustrating. then they brought me my food before the rest of the table's food was ready. and when i politely asked when the rest of the food would be ready, not wanting to eat in front of everyone, they seemed very aggravated and immediately took my plate of food back to the kitchen, without actually answering my question. when they did finally bring everyone's food, they placed a huge bowl of rice on the table even though only one of us had ordered any. when we tried to ask if all our meals came with free rice, they seemed disgruntled and immediately took the rice without giving any explanation. then another waiter explained that they were going to charge us each for rice that we hadn't ordered. the only time they were halfway decent to us was when we were leaving so they must have just been ready for us to go. they also seemed very annoyed when we asked them to split our checks. but to top it all off, my friend and i got food poisoning from the undercooked chicken. the least we ask for in a restaurant is that they have decent food, and that we don't get sick in the process. in light of all the other problems we had with this restaurant as well, i can't understand how it has managed to get such great reviews. but i would not recommend this place to anyone. you would be much better off going to one of the other restaurants in chinatown, because i can't imagine that they could be worse than this one.",

    "the food here was subpar; nothing too great and nothing too bad. i came in with a group of five for the hotpot buffet on a saturday afternoon. the restaurant wasn't busy at all, probably two or three other tables that had begun their dining as we walked in. we ordered the half spicy and half mild soup base for the hotpot. it came out with two big plates of items to be cooked in the soup, one with just beef and the other with assorted seafood and greens. the flavor of the soup was not overpowering and had a slight punch of spices. it wasn't that bad and it wasn't the best i've had. you could tell that the shrimp had been frozen for quite some time, which leads me to question the quality and shelf life of the other items on the two plates. the waitstaff was not pleasent at all. we had to ask multiple times for simple things that should have been brought out for the hot pot (i.e. sauces, strainers, napkins, and small bowls). after asking for some of the things listed above, the waitstaff slammed or threw them on the table. i would personally not recommend this location or return as there are plenty of hotpot spots around chinatown to taste.",

    "when a local( ish) restaurant is assigned the title of one of the best chinese restaurants in the nation, i figure it's worth paying a visit. lao sze chuan is very much worth the trip in to the city. we kicked off a large meal (for two) with potstickers. these were perfect! skillet browned, the interior was filled with a lot of meat but still light and not at all rubbery or chewy. we followed that up with three main dishes, so we could take some home for later. being the explorer in the family, i ordered chengdu style seafood special with tofu. also, i firmly believe that the stranger something sounds at an ethnic restaurant, the better it will taste. i still can't tell you exactly what chengdu style means, but i got many different types of seafood (scallops, whitefish, shrimp and more) poached in a light fish broth with tendercrisp red and green peppers. the tofu melts in the bowl of broth, becoming silky and breaking up into soft chunks. this works incredibly well. the fish broth had gentle seafood flavors. the texture of the tofu contrasted with the vegetables. visually, it looked like a treat. my wife settled for empress chicken, the authenticity of which i most certainly can't vouch for. nonetheless i'm happy to report the chicken came out tender and with a crisp batter skin. they eased up on the sweetness of empress chicken and provided the largest baby corn i've ever seen. it was spicy, and sweet, and definitely delivered. the (excessively long) menu has a page of authentic chinese recipes. which is another way of saying, if you want intestines, stomachs and/or chicken feet and tripe, this is the place for you. i couldn't resist hot and sour soup with blood cakes. the soup was again excellent. the broth is whitish, opaque and dotted with scallions, but not as hot or sour as the orange variety most people who have had hot and sour soup are used to. it eases up because the blood cakes are dark and, for lack of a better term, gelatinous, having the texture of extra firm tofu and the taste of gamy liver. not what i was expecting, but glad i gave it a try. so my take on lao sze chuan is that it deserves its place as one of the best chinese food places in the country. you might be better off trying less common chinese dishes (though i don't blame you if you skip the blood cake). don't go here for orange chicken. it's better to appreciate the contrasts of the colors, tastes and textures on the other items of the menu. here, that quality of chinese cooking shines through very well.",

    "this is a review for the chinatown location only. i've been going to this location since it first opened back in early 1999, i can say the food has always been pretty good, but the service at this place continue to deteriorate to the point of not respecting your customers, while the portion sizes get smaller. like many other reviewers mentioned, the staff are unable to provide the customers the service in a timely fashion, and unable to manage the flow of the traffic well. however, this latest incident pretty much just pushed me over the edge. i wanted to get some takeout last wednesday night, i called the restaurant to place my order, i got put on hold for over 10 mins, and then the woman hung up on me. i called back thinking either she forgot or they are too busy, now the phone is busy, after trying for another 5 mins, she picks up again, and put me on hold, all the while i can hear people talking loudly in the background, she hung up on me 5 mins later. called back again, she hung up on me immediately. i finally got to the restaurant, walked to the cash counter, a woman (probably the same person who has been hanging up on me) and a man, either were really busy, but neither spoke to me or asked to help. i asked if they still take orders on the phone, they said yes what do you want (not so nicely in chinese), i said it's rude to keep hanging up on a customer for the last 30 mins, she said our phone doesn't work, you can't hear me. that is such a load of b.s, i heard people talking on the background when she put me on hold, which just means she never spoke after she answered my call. i think the celebrity chef hu should really train his staff better! while he is too busy expanding his tony gourmet group through restaurant openings, he neglected to teach his staff in building a solid customer service experience for your customers!

    "this sichuan style restaurant is aimed towards american customers. i came in on a friday night, and they were very busy, but we were still able to be seated right away. they gave us a red chili oil cabbage appetizer ( which was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night asides from the dessert). we ordered shui dzu niu rou ( spicy beef and cabbage ), la dzi dza dzi ( the famous chili deep fried chicken ) gai lan xia ( broccoli shrimp the only non spicy dish), sichuan style fried thinly sliced potato with chili, and the sichuan style sesame tong yuan. the dishes are all at least 4 more than i have paid at other places, and when you take out all the chilis there was barely any meat left. speaking about the meat, the shui dzu niu rou was not spicy at all, and compared the the chili deep fried chicken, it was tasteless. the 'famous' chili deep fried chicken was the saltiest deep fried chicken i have ever had in my life. i had to have 3 mouthfuls of rice for every bite of chicken because it was so freaking salty. it wasn't even spicy at all. the broccoli chicken was fresh and edible, but so overpriced at 15. the sichuan style fried sliced potato didn't have the vinegar flavor that i was looking for, i could have made this dish so much better myself. the sesame tong yuan with the rice wine, was a good finisher, except they gave such a tiny bowl for 6. i honestly don't think i would ever come here again because the food wasn't spicy at all, it was overpriced, and way too salty. i usually don't eat that much rice, but i had to eat 3 bowls of rice here because of all the salt.",

    "so many places to eat in china town. avoid this one! my girlfriend and i were hungry so we saw the nice awards on the windows and figured why not. we were seated immediately and ordered 2 waters. we then ordered orange chicken and mongolian beef steak. the food came in about 15 minutes. we never got our waters. we had to ask for water and when it came, one has no ice and was room temperature. food wise.it was ok. nothing better than panda express. cost was 12 to 14 for each plate and an extra dollar per person for rice. service was simply horrible.didn't care about our waters, never checked in on us until after we were done eating and our glasses were empty.didn't know how to even crack a smile. tip/gratuity: 15%. we only had a party of 2 people and i read the part in the menu that mentioned gratuity is added for parties of 5+. being from mn, i'm not sure what the chicago tip policy is so i gave the lady 40 at the register and she gave me whatever change back. as we were leaving near the 2nd door already the cashier comes storming at us making a scene, demanding we owe her tip money. of course i didn't want to look like an idiot or thief, i walked up to her and said how much do i owe you. she then said blah blah 15%, 4.5x. i literally threw a 5 at her and walked out. most disrespectful and embarrassing experience and the food wasn't even that great for an award winning place. note that we saw no chinese people eating in here. they must know what's up! avoid this place and save yourself a fake chinese, bad experience. vent over. thanks :)",

    "this restaurant has a zagat rating but honestly coming from a picky hong konger taste, doesn't quite cut it. appetizers: the jellyfish appetizer was rather fishy and should have tasted more like sesame oil. the cold tofu strip dish was decently salty in a soy sauce marinated way, but that's hard to screw up. main courses: i ordered the mabo tofu; my friend got a fish stew and both were too greasy. i know greasiness is typical of mainland chinese food (unlike hong kong or taiwanese food) but i can't help but point out that it didn't add much to the dish other than making you full sooner (ha) the garlic bean sprout dish was made with baby sprouts instead of the full grown dark leafy ones. it was a more expensive seasonal winter dish too and i felt duped. i can handle spice quite a bit but what i noticed was that the dishes were predominantly spicy without being flavorful (not too much umami going on). so in sum, if you want sze chuan, go somewhere else. this place is clean but underwhelming. the service was alright and probably a lot nicer than a lot of chinese places (bc chinese service is known for being fast, cheap, good but carelessly rude ha) but i'd recommend going to a hole in the wall where they throw your dan dan noodles at you.",

    "hands down my favorite chinese restaurant in chicago. i've been going here ever since i moved to chi in 2007. i've seen the renovation to a nice place with matching tables and chairs and an upstairs eating area. the service has gotten better, and i believe they do take reservations now. hubby and i try to eat early to beat the dinner or lunch rush. everything we've ordered here has been great. my ultimate favorite is the crispy shrimp in mayo sauce. i like how crispy it is and flavored with a touch of orange, without the giant overcooked broccoli and candied walnuts that usually accompany this dish. simple and delicious. i also love the szechuan string beans. hubby is addicted to the complimentary spicy cabbage and usually orders one to go. tony's special chicken is also delicious. my family, except my mom, is not a fan of spicy. one time, when we ordered the jumbo spicy crab, hubby and mom devoured it between the two of them. hubby tried the spicy hot pot, it was pretty spicy from how red the soup base was. years ago, hubby and i were eating a quiet lunch close to opening time on a saturday morning when it wasn't busy. there were only a few other occupied tables when we suddenly heard women screaming and yelling. it turns out two of the servers were fighting when they came out from the back and started pulling each other's hair, almost knocking each other into one of the tables. another server intervened and quietly ushered both of them back to the kitchen. it was the first kitchen fight i've witnessed! another time, during peak dinner hours, we waited more than 1 hour to get our food after we ordered. the service has gotten better over the years, but regardless of service you come for the food and the food speaks for itself. there's a reason why lao sze chuan is one of cnn's 50 top chinese restaurants in the us (2012) and travel + leisure's best chinese restaurants in the us (2013). also, the sister location in uptown is not as good, even though they offer the same dishes from the menu. it's a convenient location for us, but we make the trek down to chinatown regularly to go to the original. go for the food, the lively atmosphere, and perhaps some drama!",

    "i have been to this restaurant several times. and can i say this was the worst service ever. wont be returning. came here saturday for lunch. and of course it was really busy. however there were a few tables that were empty. it was two of us who were waiting to be seated. and the hostess delayed seating us, in hopes of finding a larger group of people to seat. after 15 minutes she finally decided to seat us at the empty table that was empty the entire time. once we were seated we decided to order pork pot stickers, mongolian chicken and fried rice. we were waiting for at least 20 minutes for a server to come take our table. it was as if they were ignoring us the whole time, there was a couple who came in after us and had their order taken way before us. after flagging down the hostess to have our order taken were we able to order. the lady who came to take our order is a regular who i always see at the restaurant, she seemed either in a bad mood or just annoyed that she had to take our order. first we were given the yummy spicy kimchi, then the pot stickers arrived 10 minutes after ordering, which were really good (the food here is yummy) and another 15 minutes later the mongolian chicken dish came (which was bland and not as flavourful as the other dishes we have tried check below for some recommended dishes) during the meal, the waitress came to fill up our water glasses and she spilt the water all over my plate and tissues and didn't even apologize. so i was stuck with a watery plate and water all over the table. the service was terrible. really disappointed. yes we may have only been two people who were eating. but i was shocked at how we neglected we were. last time i will come here. there are plenty of chinese restaurants to select from. i have been here several times . if your looking for a good dish try: tonys three chili chicken dry chili chicken (really spicy) sesame chicken chili prawns vegetable fried rice",

    "3 stars for the food but the service was soo bad, disappointing, and rude that i have to take off 1 star. first off, i'm very lenient with asian restaurant service because i go there for there for the food, not the service. so taking off one star for lao sze chuan just means the service was very unacceptable for even my lenient standard. first, the food. the food are just ok for the price. they are authentic and very spicy, just how szechuan food should be and it can satisfy my craving for good chinese food. they have some non spicy food that are as good as the spicy ones, and i can say that this place is one of the best chinese restaurants in chicago. my bf and i loved the boiled fish. it's as authentic as it can get (so beware, tons of hot peppers!). i took my best friend and her family here and they loved the dry chili chicken. it has some kick in it but much milder than the boiled fish. they were very disappointed with the noodle. it was stale. bad food quality. next, the service. my best friend's dad ordered the canned tea twice and the waitress took the order, went to the kitchen, never came back, and the tea never came. my friend finally walked to the counter and asked a waiter to get her the tea from the counter. we ordered the garlic green beans in the middle of our meal, it never came out until we finished eating. it was not even crowded, there was only 3 table eating that time and they didn't have the time to prepare the green beans. when we got the bill, tadaa it was charged on us. my friend asked the waiter to take it off the bill because it never came out. he refused and argued with her in a very rude manner. he told her that it had been prepared. she argued back saying, we'd been waiting for it foerever it never came out and now he told us to wait again for it? no. in the end she still had to pay for it, left the green beans, and didn't pay any for the tip. my friend and her family were definitely not impressed with this one of the best chinese restaurants in chicago.",

    "i am simply obsessed with the spicy cabbage you get as soon as you sit down at the table. seriously, my most recent visit was to simply get a to go order of it for 5. aside from my cabbage only visit, i have been here twice: once for hot pot and once for regular food. when i came for regular food i had to try the dry chili chicken. spiciness is my jam so i was ready for the challenge. while it was pretty spicy, the chicken did not pack the punch i was expecting. it was a huge portion though and i was able to bring it home for lunch the next day. the hot pot visit was a whole other fiasco. my friends and i decided that i would be good to take a cab from lollapalooza to enjoy a giant hot pot. doesn't boiling hot and spicy soup sound great after a day of drinking and total dehydration? we thought so for some reason. don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but not the best thing to put into a stomach full of alcohol. next time we will remember to get some rice or other carbs so the hot pot settles a bit better with the booze.",

    "i lived in chengdu for a year so i can attest to the authenticity of the food at lao sze chuan (or the closest thing in us to chengdu style food). however, the service in this place is extremely disappointing. i brought my family, group of 10 ppl and a baby, to the restaurant this sunday. we had to ask twice to bring us water and a chair for the baby, and it took them 15 minutes to do either of them. after taking our order, the waiters never came over to check on us, refill the water or rice, and the restaurant was not even busy. all the helpers were just hanging out in the kitchen, and paid little to no attention to our table especially. the only reason i am even giving this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because they do have decent food, but that is not enough for me to go there again. i have tried their new location in uptown as well and the service there is much much better, and the food actually tasted better too. i would recommend everyone to go up north if you are craving some spicy sichuan cuisine.",

    "i don't like judging people or restaurants so i don't yelp but this place made me do it. i felt obliged after last night dining here that i need to write a review to help others weigh their options when they feel like spending a lovely evening with friends/family out here in chinatown getting a fix of chinese food. 1. service: there was no service. i get it. you don't expect service in a chinese restaurant especially when most of these servers probably never received any kind of service dining in their entire lives. i didn't expect any service but please at least have the human decency of acknowledging our presence or be cursorily courteous? there's no language barrier because we speak chinese too? we waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged after sitting down, and then another 30 minutes for the hotpot to be set up on the table, then another 10 minutes for the raw meat, vegetables, seafood plate to be placed on the table. the waiter didn't speak a word to us after getting our order, and made us feel like we must have wronged him grievously in the previous life. 2. food: my friend and i are both chinese americans from la. we had our fair share of chinese hotpots in our lives, and have an idea of what consumers in other parts of this world are getting when they order chinese hotpot. the meat they brought for the hotpot was a hodgepodge of old, thickly sliced meat so after being cooked in the pot, it was robbery and embarrassingly difficult to chew, and i basically swallowed them whole because my jaw just gave up on chewing them. the cod fish was too heavily battered with flour to hide the fact they were not fresh. the soup base was too oily for the spicy part and the extremely bland in the non spicy portion, and they didn't even bother to get frozen tofu. instead they served the regular tofu you get in walmart. the only thing that i felt was fresh and safe to eat there was the vegetables, which i preceded to devour after realizing that the meat/fish/tofu were not very edible. also beware of the bean curd skin or yuba or tofu skin, because it tasted like they were made from used nascar tires. after this ordeal, we decided this was a chinese restaurant from hell and we better not pay and just make a run for it. but our good conscience set in, and we paid, and left with a night full of regret and ill feeling in our bellies.",

    "recommended to this place by a few people whose opinions on food i trust. sad to say, i thought it was just okay. first off, like many other folks have already said, the service was terrible. i didn't expect it to be stellar at an authentic restaurant in chinatown, but i also didn't expect the staff to be rude to members of my party. at the end of the meal, after we had paid and signed our receipts, they had the nerve to question our tip amounts. since when is leaving a tip/tip amount not at the discretion of the guests?! this was very weird. the food itself was not bad. i'm a big fan of their dried chili chicken i would always have it at a szechuan restaurant in champaign (cravings) and i think lao's was just as good! other folks in my group had garlic chicken, moo shoo pork and mongolian beef (we're not that adventurous). the mongolian beef was probably my favorite. overall: food was okay, service was terrible. i would not go back. i think i'll stick to joy yee noodles from now on. bloop!",

    "congratulations the worst business dinner i ever attended was at your place. this isn't just overrated this food is awful. over 600 items on the menu and the best thing was the white rice. i enjoy great chinese, even spicy chinese, but spices should compliment this just overwhelms. and the good lord made lobster with the skeleton on the outside because the meat is so tender why did you, mr sze chuan, destroy the dish with so much excess peppers?! the crustacean died for nothing. ;( fried, flash fried, and deep fried are the major methods your food will be served. and your food choices are unnecessarily spicy, very spicy, and over spicy. there's better throughout town. in one meal, i was turned off by chinese, dining with my work colleagues, and several beef and fowl dishes regardless of how presented. i left hungry and had a hamburger at the end of the evening.",

    "if you like your chinese food spicy, lao sze chuan may be your ideal chinatown restaurant. come in non peak hours to avoid the wait which can climb to very high numbers early in the evening. our server was a very friendly lady and we had much better service than i'm used to in chinatown. chef's special pork with sizzling crispy rice 12.45 this pork is in a very light sweet and sour sauce. it was a great sweet and sour sauce that was a refreshing change because it wasn't heavy at all. the pork was not deep fried either which leaves you feeling like you've eaten something semi healthy. getting the dish is kind of cool because they pour the hot soup over the crispy rice making for a sizzling mixture right before your eyes. it ends up being like a soup but personally i still put it over regular white rice to cut the sweetness a bit. orange chicken 12.45 i found the orange chicken not to be very flavorful though i did taste the orange a bit. this dish had some of the best chicken i've ever had at a chinese joint. it was perfectly deep fried with the right amount of crisping to it, great crunch without drying out the chicken at all completely moist protein. overall i thought it was quite a delicious dish but would probably skip it next time just to try something new in hopes of getting a bit more flavor. spicy pork intestine 11.45 personally, i liked the small crispy pieces the best. the bigger pork intestine pieces were a bit more chewy so i was happier avoiding those pieces. i really enjoyed the flavor in this dish and if you can stomach intestine, it's worth a try. chef's special diced beef with tofu 13.45 my least favorite of the bunch. i found this dish to be a bit bland. there was quite a bit of tofu at the bottom and a lot of diced beef (of course) in a soup type of sauce. this dish was just fine but it didn't really jump out at me. steamed rice is 1 extra per bowl. overall, i'm glad i finally made it into lao sze chuan i've eaten at just about everywhere else in chinatown! it's definitely worth a stop, however with the hit or miss dishes and slightly more expensive prices, i will probably opt for other chinatown spots in the future.",

    "damn, this lemon shrimp is good. i seriously crave it. also gotta have the salt and pepper trio (shrimp, scallops and calamari) and green beans. and chili chicken is fire. for real. buuuuut, why oh why did the portions get smaller?! it's already an expensive option when going to chinatown (seriously, i can get 10 dishes for what i spend for 5 here), but to be smaller now too? ehhhh not cool. that would bring it down to 3 stars if only that lemon shrimp wasn't so damn good. you lucked out, lao sze chaun cuz i'ma keep coming back as long as that lemon crack shrimp dish stays on point and as long as i can't find it anywhere else.",

    "beware ! cockroaches inside the food ! i cant give 0 star for this miserable establishment because yelp doesn't offer it. to all people who read this post please beware of cockroaches in this filthy restaurant. i went there yesterday around lunch time and i ordered the spicy beef bowl and half way through it i found a dead cockroach inside the beef bowl .yeeeekkkk. i was so disgusted and about to throw up. i called the waitress (who barley speaks any english) and told her what i found and she said ok i will give you some discount ! can you believe that. any way i took pictures to show everyone here how filthy and disgusting that restaurant is. can you imagine the filthy operation inside the kitchen ! my wife got so sick she went straight to her doctor. this restaurant must close and the department of health must take action against this filth. ! to all: do your self a favor and never go there again. please see the pictures",

    "solid chinese place. can't really get much better than this in chicago. white people take note: everything is served on a bed of chilies, and it definitely adds up. minus a star for outrageous customer service: called for a reservation for chinese new year last year and the lady who answered assured me they were entirely booked for the evening. had my chinese friend call back (to ask in chinese), and suddenly there was space. can't say how far this extends, but honestly i've never been without a chinese speaking friend.",

    "well this was my first time in chinatown in chicago and i have to say the food was pretty good. my review is actually an interesting one. so i walk into the restaurant and it was packed. so i thought, i would not get a seat and have to wait. it was snowstorm happening and it was cold so i was like where the heck is the waiting area. well the waiting area is this small area where it is cold. the hostess was right there and said she will be right back, when she returned, handed me a piece of paper and said go upstairs and hand them this paper. i thought that's odd but i did. so they have an upstairs part of the restaurant. reminded of me being in asia so at the same time pretty cool. as we wanted to order, it was hard to communicate with our waiter. he couldn't tell us what the different sauces were, but only repeated what we said. i ended up ordering szechuan prawns without the shells. oh they charge 1 for rice; i don't see how you can eat this mean without rice, so that is not cool. when we ordered the appetizers of crab rangoon, mind you was fantastic; it had the most crab i have ever had. when he was taking the plate he specifically asked me, can i take your plate sir? he did not ask anyone at the table but me. find that odd since the plate was in the middle of the table. as for the food, it was very good, very fresh tasting and the sauce was not overpowering. as for the shrimp fried rice my friend ordered, that was simply amazing. the shrimps were big and the meal was not too soggy. in fact, i didn't taste much soy sauce which was a huge plus for me. here is where it gets weird again. once again the waiter asked me if i can take the plates from the table. when my friend asked for water, he looked at me and poured my glass full and theirs only half. i am not sure what this waiter's problem was but i do not like other being treated unfairly when we were not even rude. i found it humorous but i still do not think it was cool. will i return? sure will, food was great but the waiters need to be more aware when a table wants refills on drinks and not to treat others disrespectfully.",

(this does happen occasionally with hot pot not bc it's the restaurants' fault but bc ppl undercook the seafood or meats). e.g. i was fine the next day. 5. gratuity is already included so they could give less of a f so now that i am on the blacklist of the chinatown mafia and mr. tony hu. i just want to say that i did this for y'all. i bought a hot pot off amazon immediately after this experience lol.",

    "call 911 for my mouth i was very fortunate to get to work in china and i fell in love with two things. the kindness of everyone i met and the fantastic food. it was an incredible experience. unfortunately, when i came back to america i couldn't eat americanized asian food. it's not authentic at all. so my goal is to always search out the most authentic food i can find. this location does not let me down and i feel this is the closest food i've found to real authentic asian food. the owner, tony is a genius when it comes to his restaurants. he is probably the most successful when it comes to his caliber of authentic restaurants. okay on to the food. i've reviewed this location in the past but somehow my 5001 character review is missing on yelp. that made me sad but i'm starting a new one. it is hard for me to pick my favorites but i will try. spicy cabbage salad this is served complimentary at lunch time, if they like you. i've been snubbed a few times, maybe the waiter didn't like me. but when i do get it.i love it. fried pork pot stickers 100% house made and delicious. i made the mistake of introducing my little one to these. i'm lucky now to get a single bite out of the six that are served in an order dan dan noodles it's a small order here but i fell in love with this dish in singapore. i couldn't get enough when i was there. i'm sicilian so i love pasta but add on spicy meat and a light oily sauce and i'm in heaven. this is a must. spicy black peppered beef my wives favorite but lucky for me se can't finish it so i'm called into action to help. the beef is so tender you will wonder what they did to tenderize it. i don't even care. also the veggies are fresh and cooked perfectly. egg drop soup a recent discovery. we got it for our little one and i had a spoon. i was hoping she didn't like it but that didn't happen. she loved it and sharing soup with daddy was done. it was very tasty. dry chili chicken i saved the best for last. i must admit i avoided this dish because everyone loves it. could it really be that good? could it really be crack chicken? there was only one way to find out. i ordered it. two words! holy hotness! it was beyond my expectations. it was loaded full of red chilies. each one trying to hurt me but it was a good pain. the chicken was crispy and spicy on the outside but tender and juicy on the inside. i was eating a plate of perfection. my wife reached over to try my dish and i used a karate chop on her. i didn't really do that but i wanted to defend my dish from the invaders from the north. she looked at me after one bite like she had just had crack chicken. we have a new winner here. i wanted to take home the dry chilies and my waitress packed them up. she told me it was a good idea when i suggested it. at home you can cook up some pasta and toss them in it again. yeah a second delicious meal. score! the waitress also told me that the chilies are a special order and that they go through 75 cases of them ever 3 weeks. that is a lot of chilies. thanks tony for burning my mouth! i loved every minute of it. this is my go to restaurant in chinatown. it has taken me years to find a place like this in chicago and i'm afraid to go anywhere else. it is so good i don't want to try new places. i just want to keep eating here. in the summer, we travel here by boat. the water taxi takes you down the river to ping tom park and its a short stroll from there to the restaurant. it feels like we are actually in china and not chicago. it is a unique experience and such a fun family adventure. so if you like spicy, then this is the place! i can hardly wait to go back and get burned again with this delicious food.",

    "dry chilli chicken and sole fillet and sour cabbage soup. amazing idea! the soup was super spicy with all the black pepper but that only helped open up my sinuses ;) don't be fooled by the number of red chillies accompanying the chicken; the dish isn't as spicy as it looks but the chicken is a perfect accompaniment to the soup. the rest of the menu looks quite exciting and a bit overwhelming. we focused on the chef's selections right up front. there is a bit of a wait during the weekends but its worth it!",

    "while the food here might be quite good (according to some), you must be careful of what you do order. i would highly recommend steering clear of anything that says with bone. these dishes are usually really delicious, however, the bone is cut up and not whole, thus making the dish a pain to eat. also, the service here is.okay. it is noticeable that the waiters treat those of the same ethnic background better, but this doesn't bother me (it is chinatown, after all). what does bother me though, is the lack of communication between the waiter and the patron. the waiter/waitress barely knows english outside of water?, order?, and a few other words, much less understanding english. i ended up getting a different dish that what i wanted because my waiter didn't understand what i wanted and i had to point to it on the menu, but i guess he read the wrong thing. this also didn't bother me as what i got was still good. but i haven't the slightest idea what it was. my tips for this place? bring someone who speaks chinese fluently. it'll greatly smooth and enhance the experience. don't order anything that has with bone on the menu unless you plan on spending a loooooong time picking apart your meat from the bone. other than that, the food is good and i will be back sometime in the future, though i'm not in any hurry.",

    "china town was really hopping saturday night and all the restaurants were busy, especially this one; we got our number and stood waiting; even though there were copies of the menu available, by the time they were ready to seat us i had pretty much forgotten my research. so i asked the owner with the big crazy watch who happened to be there what to order. the owtbcw insisted i order the beef satay, item 158 or something as an entree; i had my doubts but ordered it anyway. big mistake, the satay was dry and not even remotely as good as the indonesian, malaysian and thai versions i've had. i also ordered as appetizers the cold pork with garlic sauce (very good) and the rabbit with bones (more bones than rabbit). my wife ordered an entree that i warned her against (salt and pepper lamb) which like most salt and pepper dishes is deep fried. service was pretty disorganized; entrees came before appetizers, some people served before others, etc. our order probably confused them. the other couple with us ordered very conservatively and enjoyed all their dishes, but i don't recommend that. i am willing to go back and give it another try concentratng on the dishes they (supposedly) do best.",

    "out of all the delicious meals i had in chicago, this was the restaurant that made me wish i lived there. i don't want this review to be about how much better chicago's chinatown is compared to dc's chinatown so let's just move on to the points i loved about lao sze chuan. first of all, i am very impressed by how big the menu is here. there are easily over 100 dishes! we picked four that we thought was the most interesting (a cold rabbit dish, whole pork shoulder in chili sauce, cumin lamb, and spinach with ginger). with a menu this big, i was blow away by how uniquely different each dish tasted and manages to be so delicious as well. the prices are ridiculously affordable too. the two of us only ended up spending like 25 each. i like that the servers spoke mandarin as well as english. they were very helpful in giving recommendations. i'm surprised that this place wasn't more packed on a saturday lunch when we went. the restaurant itself has a very clean feel to it with a clean white interior, which is also a welcoming change from chinese restaurants in dc. but i digress. go eat here! you won't be disappointed! pro tip: it definitely helps to have a high spice and salt tolerance to eat here.",

    "this was god awful! yes, i said it god awful! let me repeat it once more so people get it's god awful!. i have been coming to chicago chinatown for over 18yrs+ and i have noticed a few changes. most of the restaurants have been renovated with modern decor and menu options have expanded! butttt the quality in chinese food has been in a spiral downturn with quality while increasing prices! i remember coming to chinatown and spending 5 7 dollars a plate now its 12 dollars a plate for some measly vegetables! so let me begin with this restaurant! some stranger recommended this place so i decided to try it since it was one of few restaurants i have not been too. we sat down and the people took a while to take notice and begin our order not a deal killer but there wasn't too many people in the restaurant. next looked at the menu option lots and lots of choices! but prices seemed pricey for relative to what you are getting. we order spring rolls! these were cold! how do you serve me cold spring rolls? imagine taking some spring rolls out of the freezer and letting it nuke in the microwave! that's how they tasted like not crispy as they should! and definitely not what i paid for. next we ordered variety of vegetables it had mainly american veggies and no bak choy which i think should automatically be inside mixed chinese veggie plate. they are trying to cater to the west (american) rather than keeping it's standard chinese vegetables! not american broccoli but chinese broccoli! i don't go to chinatown to get american vegetables. tea cold cold cold! and no we did not order cold jasmine tea! fried rice was the worst chinese fried rice i have ever had! they literally put in american frozen veggies and tasted like american fried rice. hardly any eggs. the color was looked like they just dumped some soy sauce and cooked it on the wok with frozen vegetables! and that's how it tasted! our bill came out to be around 30 dollars! what a complete waste of my money! i am not too sure how we have over 770 ratings for this restaurant and averaged to 4stars! maybe i just had a bad experience but i can tell you that the chinese food 18yrs ago tasted better than the new chinatown in chicago. yes i like the decor and the renovations they have done in new chinatown but the chinese food has actually gone down and i mean down hill in many of the restaurants. joy yee still good though! i believe a lot of the restaurants are more concerned about trying to cater to the west rather than keeping it chinese food to drive more revenue/profit! they are getting lazy hoping for americans to go based on the idea they are in chinatown. i have rated it a 1star hoping to drive the overall rating down to 2 3stars since i believe this was a 1 2star experience. don't go here i don't recommend it!",

    "i've got a few issues here after dining in, rather than carrying out. prior to arriving, review the menu in the privacy of your own home for an hour or two. it's obnoxiously extensive. and thank you, but i can do without all the dishes prepared with blood, brains, lungs, entrails, and gore at large. best bet is to keep those selections on an authentic style menu that you keep hidden along with the lunch menus you don't want anyone to know exist. if it's lunch, ask for the lunch menu. they won't give it to you otherwise, and expect you to order off the dinner menu at a significant up charge for the exact same entrees. shady. also, don't accept recommendations from any of the wait staff. we took some suggestions on both entrees big mistake. i agree with other comments here, the spicy dishes are far too spicy for the average heat seeker. we should have stuck with our original order. and prepare to wait for your drinks, or not receive them at all. you will get water and tea, and that's it (unless you byob and they'll rush to open for you to get their 10 corking fee). but alas, here is my main reason for writing this review i recently brought an out of town friend to lunch here last week, and glanced over at an empty table in the dining room. seated were two servers working on what looked like a large frosted layer cake. in reality, it was a huge mound of filling for crab rangoon that was being stuffed and sealed into wrappers. i was shocked and immediately sickened. now, i don't work for the illinois department of health, but anyone can clearly observe that many food safety rules were tossed out the window here. some may say, what did you expect, it's filthy chinatown. no excuse. how many potential health department violations do we have here? the first is that two of the servers at the restaurant were doing this themselves. you can't be both a food server and preparing food in this type of sit down restaurant. second, they were doing it right out in the open at an empty table in the dining room, picking up and putting down their utensils right on the table in plain view of patrons. third, said food was not in a contained kitchen/prep environment or sanitized work area. fourth, the food product, which contained both seafood and dairy, was not stabilized at a food safe temperature, and should have been in a bowl with ice. fifth and finally, gloves were not worn for the duration, and i clearly saw both servers leave the table and touch things and return without washing their hands. i'm sure the michelin rating committee would have swallowed their spoons had they seen this! sure, you may think that boiling oil kills all germs and bacteria, but tell me what you think when it's coming out both ends, or worse, you end up in northwestern memorial with a food borne parasite that puts you out of commission for weeks. perhaps management is too busy focusing on its new hotspot lao 18 in river north, but that's no excuse to let quality and cleanliness standards fall off the cliff at the other locations within the empire . . .",

    "this place is located in the new chinatown square location on the nearby corner of cermak and archer. when we arrived, there was an employee outside to greet us. they told us they were closed because of a broken pipe, so sadly we started to walk away. but just then we saw them sitting other people. scandalous! racist? maybe, although i'm asian too. anywho, we went inside and got seated in a round table. i asked the waitress of the so called busted water pipe and she said its somewhat fixed. i guess i really don't need to know how that works. on one hand though, they did give us 4 glasses of water. there were 9 of us. no worries, i didn't want to drink whatever water they were able to scrounge up from. the decor there was nothing special, the seats were somewhat weird it was clear plastic chairs. on one table was a folder that said health inspection so at least we knew we were under the careful scrutiny of the health inspector. after waiting for a good 20 minutes, we finally got some of our dishes. a gruff looking asian dude (co owner maybe?) greeted us and apologized for the wait. he then was making small talk and was making choking gestures and sounds as he was describing the health inspection lady and how she took up all of his time. i asked him if he passed the inspection and he said yes, in which case i only thought it was appropriate to give him a standing ovation (seriously, i did). the food was decent there's a common theme to these dishes, and it was hot hot hot! they literally drown the food with dry chilli peppers. the dry chilli chicken was extremely tasty and spicy i'm drooling and sweating just writing about it. the tony's chicken was also delicious. it was deep fried in a light subtle batter and it came with chopped peppers and onions. some of our coworkers got fried rice (so white of em) and others got the fried eggplant which was ok. in the end though, your mouth is burning and you're sweating so much from the food and lack of ac, you'd think this ordeal should be called bikram eating (much like bikram yoga, its something that isn't necessary, but it exists). a tip is to definitely get water and your tongue will be begging for it! bathroom review: i didn't check out the bathroom this round, as the fact that we were eating at an establishment with a broken water pipe was enough for me to just hold it in. i feel like i have let my fellow yelpers down, for which case i sincerely apologize. next time. next time.",

    "! don't go to this place ! ! 1 hr wait, forget order twice ! this place serves a good authentic chinese food, and i used to have a good experience here. last sunday evening, the restaurant was crowded but not full. we ordered 6 main dishes and 1 appetizer. after 30 mins of waiting, all tables got their food already, even ones that came after us. we asked our waiter to see what happen. then, she realized that the restaurant forgot our order. however, that's not the worst part. we waited for another half an hour, and the food still did not come out. we talked with the manager and he said that we have to wait for another 20 minutes. we just couldn't bare with this shit anymore and decided to leave. i believe place lost our order twice, and they did nothing to resolve it. they know that we had waited for 1 hour, but they did not even try to put our order into head of the queue if you just want to eat their free cabbages appetizer and drink tap water for the whole meal, this is the place for you.",

    "i haven't been here in years so i wanted to relive my favorite dishes before penning a review. we just simply ordered the first two items from the spicy section of the specialties menu: dry chili chicken and ma po tofu. while both dishes were better than i remembered, they were also much more spicy than i remembered as well. i'm no noob when it comes to spice but the combination of these two dishes kicked our asses. i was constantly wiping sweat off my head and face and sipping water. sort of embarrassing but worth the wait and suffering. my only gripes are that the chicken had way too little chicken and way too many dry chili peppers and the tofu itself was super extra salty, as if it were infused with salt. the chicken dish literally had more peppers than chicken volume wise. i'd say a 3:1 ratio of pepper to piece of tiny chicken. i still loved the hell out of it but it started to get annoying when half of my plate was a mound of peppers. the saltiness of the tofu can be offset with copious amounts of rice resulting in an excellent savory flavor. i think this is the most spicy ma po tofu i've ever had in my life. we waited for over 30 minutes to get in all the while watching the guy ahead of us in line continuously try to bribe the hostess with what looked like a dollar bill to be seated next. i've done the line hop via bribe before and it takes at the very minimum 10 but more towards 20 for this to succeed. we just watched him and laughed. our waitress literally came one time to take our order and never came back. not once. i had to have a chat with the manager who was very apologetic and cleared our table. then promptly dropped a dish and broke it. then came back for more dishes from another table and slipped on what he spilled the first time smack on his ass. the entire restaurant went dead silent and cringed in pain for him as it was a tremendous fall. the kind where peter griffin grabs his shin and goes ooooooooooowww. ssssssssssssss. ooooooooooowwww. ssssssssss for minutes on end. he was still cringing in pain as we exited the restaurant and i asked him if he was okay and he gave me a courageous smile. great food, cheap plastic chairs, and shitty service. everyone else had great service from their servers, ours just disappeared. oh well, i'll be back to torture my taste buds and intestines again next time.",

    "dishes are generic and so so, lots of fried and heavily (greasy, sugary, salty) sauced meats and white rice they charge you extra for who's so cheap they charge extra for the white rice with entrees? ordered a dish today (3rd but last time i go back) that i asked about and the waiter said it was sliced pork in sauce. i thought he said soup and i asked, it isn't soup, right? and he said, no, in a hot and sweet sauce and i said as long as it isn't soup that was fine. sure enough, thirty long minutes later they bring a bowl of hot and sour soup with pork chunks. i immediately said i did not want the dish and they refused to take it back. i didn't order soup and i threw a mild fit until someone finally took it away. our waiter was pointing at us and talking about us after this so i didn't bother eating, my companions ate in silence and we left. the waiter got no tip but i'd tell him as a future tip to either work in the kitchen or learn the menu better and never argue with a table full of paying customers. i will never be back and think many other options are better in chinatown.",

    "this place has tourist trap written all over it. the food and service was nothing more than mediocre. i came here the other day for ayce hotpot and while the service was lacking (just like every other chinese restaurant), it was just getting ridiculous. on average, we had to remind our waiter three times on what additional meats, veggies and sides we wanted. only for them to come back 15 minutes later with half of our order. asking for soy sauce, refill on water and the check was also a painful task. the meats get fattier and fattier the more you order and they practically have the ac on the lowest setting to get you hot, sweaty, and down right uncomfortable so that you want to gtfo. eating hotpot here is like signing a contract with a mobile carrier with all its hidden fees and rules. a meal starts off at 17 but remember to tack on 2/person for holidays/weekends, 6/order of shrimp and more 'expensive' seafood/meats and limited veggies/sides option. i rather go to sweet station though their service is not the best either. two stars, because i came here for non hotpot before and the food was okay. though you can definitely find better la zi ji (dry chili chicken) at other restaurants in chinatown.",

    "750 odd reviews in, the averages at lao sze chuan in the reviews i've read and now the experience i have sum it all up: whether you like it or not, the service is terrible, the food is great, the food is even better if you're with other chinese people (sorry, fact) and while the food is tasty, it's relatively bland, so know that any of your yeah, i'm not that down with spicy food will be perfectly fine at lsc. the prices are good but not nearly as cheap as some other spots in chinatown; that said, our group of six spent 108 plus tip last night (typical of other chinatown spots, bring cash to save 5 10% on the final bill) for about 10 entrees and 2 3 small plates. when i go back, i will be with native chinese speakers; honestly, it was embarrassing to watch the servers take time and be jovial with other chinese diners then come to our black and white patron laden table and provide service that was essentially what the f do you want? and bring out dishes a little slower to our group. something tells me this goes away when our, ahem, demographics align closer with the chinatown community. hey, i get it, but just don't make it so blatantly obvious!",

    "very disapointing! we took my dad there for a father's day luncheon treat and man what a letdown. first about the service. even though they knew it was going to be a very busy day (a podium and hostess was stationed outside the front door), they had only two waiters and three bus people to service the entire restaurant. we arrived around 12:15 and were promptly seated but given only two menus for four people. a waiter came by about 10 minutes later and said he would be right back to take our order and rushed away. we noticed that other guest were given a small plate of hot chilli cabbage right after they sat down, but not our table.no big deal. ten minutes later and still no waiter; it was impossible to get his attention because he would rush by without looking around. another ten minutes goes by and he finally sees me waiving my arm and comes by to takes our order. about fifteen minutes goes by and our order of beef tenderloin with pea pods arrives before our appetizers, which took another ten minutes. we ask them for rice and water. ten minutes later we are told that they didn't have any steamed fresh tilapia because the delivery truck didn't come that day; i ordered some other kind fresh whole fish. the eggplant with pork arrives. waiter comes back ten minutes later (notice a pattern here?) saying that they are completely out of fresh fish and hands me a menu to make another seafood selection. wouldn't you know it, he then disappears again for ten minutes. we get our salt pepper pork ribs. finally the rice and water comes. waiter comes back and we order a hot shrimp dish. almost finished eating and it's now about 2:10 and no shrimp. i was about to cancel, but someone comes by and said it was coming right out.yeah right. yep, it arrives about ten minutes later. i won't comment on how long it took to get and pay the check. we finally left the joint around 2:40. looking around, i saw about two thirds of the customers were without food and very few smiles. what really burned me was that a tour operator led group of about sixteen people came in about a half hour after us and they were seated, fed and finished in less than an hour. now about the food. it's on par with an average chinese all you can eat buffet but with a liberal application of hot peppers. lao's description of his dishes may sound exotic but the final product did not measure up to his words or hype. the pot stickers were very chewy and doughy and the filling almost tasteless, absolutely not freshly made. except for the heat from peppers, everything we ordered was otherwise bland and over sauced. not worth the 15 per dish average that they were charging. i noticed that just a third of the customers were chinese.not a good endorsement of the food quality at lao she chuan. we have eaten at his lao beijing and lao shanghai restaurants with almost equal disappointment. perhaps tony hu may have lost quality control by over extending himself with too many locations?",

    "a previous visit to lao sze chuan resulted in my friends and me going to lao shanghai because of the long wait time. i never have had to wait for a table at chinatown! but that's how famous and crowded lao sze chuan is! this time around, i went there for lunch with a group of work friends. if you are a large party and call ahead, you can get a reservation! we were seated at a large round table, menus handed to us, green tea placed in front of us in a large pot and a nice plate of a chinese version of kimchi (maybe there's a name for it.). a good start. we ordered a lot of food, so i'll just mention the ones we really liked fish in bean sauce, tony's three chili chicken, the dry chili chicken was quite good dry to be had on its own, the bass with tofu and rice served in a large bowl was refreshing, and the jumbo shrimp appetizer. a friend of mine is a big fan of the crispy orange beef. all the others were alright. the peppercorn chicken was extreme; too much peppercorn so i would avoid it all costs unless you want to experience that numbing sensation peppercorn induces. the portions are large and well worth the price. my issue? our appetizers came at the very end; the waiters were bordering on rudeness when we asked about missing dishes. the host, however, made up for it with her courteousness. but i think i might stick with ordering take out from them rather than endure long wait times and mediocre service.",

    "this place is a haven for food lovers everywhere. it's got the holy trinity (or at least to me) of what a good restaurant should be. one is atmosphere. you know you're at a good chinese restaurant when it's packed with actual chinese people, and this place is packed all the time. the second is authenticity. when you go to a restaurant, you're either craving a certain type of food or are trying to experience something new. if the food isn't authentic, then you might as well as go to insert restaurant with wok in its name and get their americanized chicken. i mean general gao's. this place is quite authentic, seeing as they not only offer the standard menu found at other szechuan places, but also the rare dishes found in china (think frogs, rabbits and various parts of a cow). the third is food. being a szechuan restaurant, most of their dishes are going to be spicy and flavorful. and trust me, when i say spicy, i mean get ready for multiple bathroom trips spicy because you'll be drinking glass after glass of water. this may seem like a bad thing to most of you, but that's when you know a dish is good in szechuan standards. i can list off what i got, but i highly recommend bringing some adventurous friends and trying something out of your comfort zone. i can't promise you'll find everything to your liking, but i can promise you a great, authentic experience.",

    "i went in expecting amazing. expectations can be your achilles heal. at least it was for lao sze chuan. first, it was a hot day. as in, ten steamy degrees above average and lao sze chuan did not have ac. they just had a box fan in the front door. a box fan that some employee would drape his body on blocking the breeze for the entire freakin' restaurant. punk kid. second, my guest is a chef. as in a caterer. i loved his company and all, but he shared a few observations about lao sze chuan that irked me. like, how they were operating with minimal wait staff and about how they were stingy with certain ingredients. he explained how lao sze chuan must be making a killing which is naaaat what i wanted to hear when i was ornery from being uncomfortably hot. the servers were freakishly slow for our table. we observed two other tables who came in after us get their food before we even ordered. when we ordered, we hit a language wall with our server. she didn't understand us and we didn't understand her. she got us another server who successfully took our order. we got appetizers: crab rangoons, pig ears and cucumbers, duck (?) dumplings; and entrees: spicy sauteed pork and dry rub ribs all for just over 46. all of the food was delicious. not so delicious that i would go back for them or anything, but they were all good. i think the portions were good too. the two things that set lao sze chuan apart from other chinese restaurants are: 1) they have a phenomenal reputation. 2) their menu is crazy long. like, instead of saying szechuan style [followed by a list of meats and veggies options], each option is listen separately. it was impossible to figure out their specialty. i would probably try lao sze chuan for take out if i lived closer. the dining in experience was really horrible but the food was good hence take out preference. note: they serve alcohol but they also have a byob option with a corkage fee. i didn't pay attention to the fee. if i ever go again (which is extremely unlikely) i will definitely bring my own alcohol. it'll probably enhance the experience.",

    "i've experienced lao szechuan on 2 occasions. while i enjoyed it both times, i don't necessarily consider this restaurant one of the top ten chinese restaurants in the usa, as advertised in the restaurant and on the menu. since i'm from the sf bay area and frequently visit relatives in los angeles and seattle all three of these asian populated areas have a plethora of chinese restaurants that surpass lao szechuan. anyways, onto the food. once, i came with a group of 5 friends and had the deluxe hot pot special (<a href=http:/www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lao sze chuan chicago 2?select=2gpp6ah3ivsszzsxvo9sbq2gpp6ah3ivsszzsxvo9sbq>yelp.com/biz_photos/lao .</a>). 16.99/person for groups of 2+, 19.95/person for a single person. we chose the half spicy/half non spicy soup base, since some of us girls couldn't handle the szechuan level of spiciness. this came with a variety of vegetables, meat, and fish balls, etc. everything was fresh and delicious, and the steaming hot broth was especially satisfying in the dead of chicago winter. my only complaint about the hot pot special was that the portions seemed kind of small. i wasn't completely full at the end of the meal. the second time, lao szechuan catered for an event at my university. there were steaming hot trays of maybe. 10 or so different dishes, such as chow mein, fried rice, bok choy, string beans, broccoli beef, etc. everything was pretty good, but i've had better. overall: this place is definitely one of the better chinese restaurants in chicago, along with minghin cuisine, but in no way do i think it's worthy of it's top 10 in us rating. but of course, authentic asian cuisine is rarer in the midwest than the west coast so i should just be grateful. i'm so excited that their new location is opening one block from my apartment! no more long el rides down to chinatown.",

    "atmosphere it's okay. they get crowded at all times, not much room to wait and the hostess is rude. very disorganized how they give out numbers. we were there before several other people and they were immediately seated. when i told her we were there waiting first, she just said.oh with dumb look on her face. service, horrible. oh my gosh. so after you get seated, the server takes about 10 minutes to give you a menu then another few minutes to come back and get your drink order. if you have questions, forget it, they aren't helpful. yup, servers are rude. what we order? hot and sour soup crab rangoon dried chili chicken shrimp fried rice salt and pepper pork chops pan fried noodles husband loves the hot and sour soup. says it's spicy, but the best he has had. he tries hot and sour soup everywhere. they put a lot of cilantro on it and nuts. cilantro my husband loves, nuts, not so much. crab rangoon, tasted like they re fried them. gross. not good at all and all cream cheese inside. took two bites, spit it out. dried chili chicken, holy spicy. husband liked this a lot, it was too spicy for my taste and we asked for it mild. don't think mild is in their vocab. shrimp fried rice. the flavoring was good, huge shrimp but lacked rice. it was more shrimp than rice so i had to mix white rice in with this. salt and pepper pork chops, awesome! best i've had. nicely breaded, great flavor, slight heat. pan fried noodles. not good, not a fan. it had so much brown sauce on it. it was almost like soup. i might as well have ordered a noodle soup dish. saving grace was really the salt and pepper pork chops. so good. service, horrible. getting a server to pay attention to you is impossible but they do speed it up when you are about to pay, you know so they can get you out of there and seat more people. i think they are understaffed. there are like 2 or 3 servers running around and they don't have specific tables. i don't get it. hire more people, place is busy all the time. sadly, after my meal, i had an upset stomach for 2 days.",

    "what is lao sze chuan made of? chili, oil and everything nice. so when you're feeling a lil' frigid, there's nothing that some intense spice can't fix. i'm pretty sure by the time you finish your meal you'll shed a few pounds from profuse perspiration and it'll deem you a champion in a wet t shirt competition. from that first plate of spicy cabbage brought out, it is a test of one's capsaicin threshold. even so you still find yourself picking it up between your chopsticks, putting it right in your mouth, and perhaps taking a big gulp of ice cold water. yep, it's that addictive. we continued to order dishes according to a variety of heat levels from mild to intense. shanghai style jellyfish crunchy texture finished off with a hint of sesame oil. dan dan noodle snack spaghetti like noodles topped with meat and pickled veggie, green sprigs, and fiery sauce on the bottom to toss. boiled sole fish in spicy szechuan sauce definitely not for the faint of heart (ulcer beware!), my favorite dish of all even if i end up with oily lips my kiss would light you on fire. string beans with sour pickle good alternative to mellow down the heat and change up the flavors if my tastebuds haven't already burnt off. definitely skip the blah salt and pepper lamb overly battered, greasy, and muttony. good restaurant probably a one hit wonder for me. food swimming in oil and chili can be intimidating hey it's nice to break the healthy habit and splurge sometimes, even if it means i'll put myself through agony by shatting out fire the next day.",

    "everything i've had at this restaurant has been great maybe too great. i've enjoyed the (complimentary) spicy cabbage, szechuan string beans (dare i say, better than girl and the goat's green beans?), crispy shrimp in mayo sauce, and tony's chicken with three chili so much that i have a hard time branching out and ordering anything else. i really only get to try new menu items when i bring a friend here and can sneak a couple bites from their plate. the portions are large and the prices are certainly reasonable. i have no problem calling this the best chinese food in chicago, partly because there's almost no good chinese outside of chinatown and argyle street, but mostly because the food really is that good. the menu is enormous and there is plenty of something for everyone from proteins to vegetables and everything in between. the decor is pretty poor (the uptown location is much nicer) and communicating with the wait staff can be a bit tricky but who really cares. the important thing is that you are getting great food on a consistent basis. if i lived anywhere remotely close to chinatown i would be here once a week. note: a large number of reviewers claim the food is incredibly spicy here but i just don't find that to be the case. maybe my taste buds have just adjusted to spicier food over time, i just don't get the heat. if you want more heat, i'm pretty sure you can request specific dishes be made extra hot.",

    "i struggle with giving this place anything less than 3 stars because without tony hu we would be without semi decent sichuan food in chicago. i have to say though lao sichuan is not nearly as good as other sichuan restaurants in the u.s., in new york or even in boston. this hurts my pride a little i know we're not new york, but surely we can do better than boston when it comes to good food? somehow the sichuan peppercorns they use are not quite as flavorful as other places ive been, so the food ends up being very spicy but lacking in dimension. as an asian person, i have to say that the rice they served me last time was just unacceptable it was old and lukewarm as if microwaved and was still clumped together in the shape of the pot that it was in. not serving fresh rice, not doing the basics right demonstrates complacency or lack of pride in your food. of the two times i tried the hotpot, once the vegetables didnt look washed and the second time the cooking mechanism came with leftover noodles stuck to the side of it from the last customer. we have found wrappers in the sauteed spinach. also, the last time i went, the waiter refused to give me a la carte pricing on the hotpot, though i have previously picked my own ingredients there before. we ended up paying 18 per person and getting a lot of food we didn't want and not getting enough of what we did want. with all said they do have a huge menu, and i do think it's better that we have this place than nothing at all. i just wish it were better.",

    "for me and my buddies, china town in chicago is a place we seek to find food after a drunken night or a late night movie show. and so one night, after helping my friend move out of his apartment, we came across this place tired and hungry. it was past 10:30 and we quickly went in only to notice that this place was still busy. our waiter wasn't very eager to lead us through the menu, which stretched a few pages long, but was helpful enough to suggest what and how we should order. and so we ordered the dry chili chicken, szechuan string beans and ex spicy fish fillet in a flaming wok with tsingtao beer as appetizers. trust me the ex spicy fish fillet in a flaming wok is a spicy hot food lover's delight. and it's not the stupid hotness that you get a wild wings; there is flavor to be found here even though it is hot. the dry chili chicken, which is deep fried, was also nice with hotness imparted through dry red chilies. for the main course we decided on eating something mild and ordered egg fried rice with mongolian chicken. it was alright but it definitely lacked the zing the first two dishes provided. to eat only once at la szechuan is like going to six flags and just doing one ride. you need to come here at least three times to enjoy the variety and authenticity this place is so celebrated for. all in the all, la szechuan is a place that offers authentic chinese food that is a far cry from the watered down american chinese we've all come to know, like and eat at places like pei wei or p f chang's.",

    "extensive menu, very unusual items available. food pretty good, but far from one of the best in the country, as is trumpeted on the menu. service poor to indifferent. worth a three star rating ordinarily, with the food counterbalancing the service. but. after finishing my meal and while on a cell call, i noticed some commotion near the cash register area, which is at the back of the dining room, near the kitchen. somone had screamed and other guests were looking under their tables. other waitstaff moved to the end of the dining room and were watching the under table area. i quickly finished my cell call and asked my server what was going on. the server told me, nothing. i said it didn't look like nothing, with someone screaming and other patrons looking at the floor around their seats. the server repeated that nothing was going on. a few moments later, i felt something behind my back, and startled, looked behind me. it appeared that my jacket had slipped off the back of my chair and settled at the small of my back. but a minute or two later, i scooted my chair back to put on my jacket, and a brown rat about 9 in length (body length not including the tail), scurried from behind me, along a windowsill, jumped down onto the floor and ran back toward the kitchen. not wanting to cause a panic, i pointed it out to waitstaff, who seemed content to let it go. i confronted the server who had lied to me, who only grinned/grimaced and shook his head. the manager came and presented my check and left without saying a word. never once did management alert customers that there was a rat loose in their dining room. in fact, the only apparent reaction to this issue was to continue service as per normal, evidently so as not to interrupt the flow of money through the cash register. if management had said, please, everyone. step outside for a few minutes we think we may have a problem but we'll get you right back in., that would have been a different story. but to continue service and deny that anything was happening: completely unacceptable.",

    "went there for lunch on a rainy monday afternoon. food was good and portions were big there were two of us and we ordered soup, spring rolls and two entrees and had lots of leftovers. a couple of warnings, though if you're there at lunchtime, ask for the lunch menu, which has smaller entrees at half the price of the dinner menu. when we came in they didn't offer us the lunch menu until i asked for it, and when i did our waitress suddenly acted very annoyed. when i then tried to ask a question about the lunch menu she just pointed at the menu, said, read the menu, and walked away as if i'd insulted her by asking for the lunch specials. bottom line was that the food was good, but not so fantastic that it made up for our waitresses' bad attitude.",

    "i was here saturday with a party of 7 for my mother's birthday. i chose this particular restaurant based on a yahoo article that ranked lao sze chuan as number one in the nation for chinese food, as well as it's authenticity. i know my mom is very picky when it comes to chinese food seeing as she can make a variety of the food herself, plus at a fraction of the cost. i figured with the restaurant's popularity, i'd make a reservation to avoid the wait. i sure am glad that i did, seeing that there was a line of 10 or so people waiting when we arrived. the dishes we ordered were: orange chicken three cups chicken special dry chili chicken sweet and sour ribs house special beef house style in hot platter mayonnaise shrimp the mayonnaise shrimp was pretty good; it's not overwhelmingly smothered in mayo like at other restaurants and the batter was nice, light, and crispy. the beef hot platter, sweet and sour ribs, and three cups chicken were all just okay. nothing that really stood out in my mind. the special dry chili chicken was covered in peppers, although it wasn't too spicy. others at the table agreed and enjoyed the dish. the favorite dish was the orange chicken, which again had a nice light batter and was covered in a delicious sauce. all in all, the food ranged from good to just okay. nothing we ordered was really authentic, which i was a little disappointed about. but i think next time i will just come back with my parents and give it another try. i think they were trying to please the palates of our american spouses. i hear the mapo dofu is good but that was a dish i never liked as a kid, so i passed on it. i had to take two stars off because of the horrible service. we were constantly trying to flag down a waiter, which really shouldn't have been that hard. we honestly could have finished our dinner in half the time we were there. for a place as small and popular as it was, you would think the servers would be more attentive to get you what you need and out, and then seat the long line of people that's waiting outside. no. we had waited 10 mins at the table for a check, and only had told my family to head out since i'd be paying anyways, one of the servers finally remembered we had asked for a check. even then i sat i at the empty table for another 5 minutes before i was finally handed a bill. it also seems that a majority of the workers do not speak chinese, which was a bit disappointing. i know my parents like to order in chinese since their english isn't so good, but the employees aren't very good at english either. it was very unusual. maybe they just couldn't hear us. at the end of day, please work on your service. for a place that should be number one in the nation, it could be better. i'd definitely give this place another try.",

    "i am really perplexed by all the people who think this place is great. our group of 9 dined here last night. if the food was great (which it is not), i would have been willing to overlook the lack of ambiance and awful service. we were seated right away but waited 20 minutes for a drink order. the service level never improved from there. the door on the second floor room didn't close well and it was so cold in there that most of the diners in the room wore their coats to eat. since there were 9 of us, we did try quite a few things and were impressed with none. bland spring rolls, rubbery pot stickers were how we started the meal. the crispy duck that one person ordered was actually soggy duck with no flavor. the beef quality in both the mongolian beef and the szechuan beef was poor. it was chewy and dry with too much grizzle. the chicken in the chicken dishes was bland. one person did an individual hot pot and though it had a lot of heat but no flavor. while the shrimp was fine in the seafood dish, the scallops were not and the oyster sauce was as bland as bland gets. i honestly think they have too many dishes on the menu to execute any of them well. they should pare down the menu to just a few things and do them better.",

    "first of all i loved lao sze for a very long time. it has the best, spiciest, and strangely awesome dishes ever. spicy beef, soup pot, pickled maw all great. however in the last year or so, their service have gone from rely good, to not so good, to really bad. i will wait patiently for food, because i understand it has to be prepared. by when, on two separate occasions it takes a waiter an upwards of 20 minutes to even acknowledge our table in a semi filled restaurant it's a problem for me. it's even greater problem if the dishes come out at an interval of 5 10 minutes, so by the time som people are close to finishing, someone, is just getting their food. even mor of an issue, is what seems to be an assumption that because i am not chinese, i will not know the difference between soy sauce and a dumpling sauce, or steamed v fried, or other preparation and recipe details. on three separate occasions our orders were messed up because waiter/ waitress didn't understand what we were ordering. some of the older waitresses are great super helpful, eager to explain thing, but the younger ones are killing it they all act like they are too cool to work there. so to sum it up great food, really sucky service as of late. not sure if i'll go back any time soon.",

    "hah. another negative review filtered by yelp. will throwing them another star get it into the ratings? [edited] i was excited to try this place, since all my chinese friends (including my girlfriend) said it was the best chinese in town. we went between christmas and new year's, and boy were we in for a surprise. after waiting in frigid weather for 20 minutes (they refused to let us wait in the entryway), we sat down and were excited to eat. the three of us ordered a pork dish, hot and sour soup, a chinese broccoli dish, and squid. the hot and sour soup and the squid came without incident, and were pretty good. that's when the chaos began. we got a beef tripe dish that we hadn't ordered, and sent it back. the broccoli dish arrived after an extended delay, and was fine right up until the point we found the fingertip of a pink latex dishwashing glove in it. having lost our appetite, we got the check (after looking for our server for a good ten minutes) and found that not only had the beef tripe been included in the bill, so had a chicken dish. we argued, and the two dishes were removed, but the original pork dish (which we hadn't received) was included. had to argue again to have that removed. unbeknownst to us, they were charging a mandatory 15% service fee during this period, and therefore to add insult to injury we weren't able to not leave a tip. two of the three people at the table were native chinese speakers, and there was definitely no mix up during the ordering. at least when they have a guaranteed tip, the entire staff of this restaurant could not give a damn. slow service, careless order taking, debris in the food, and surly waitstaff never again. chef tony or whatever his name is has gotten to big for his britches. wake up you're not that important, and if your restaurant continues to operate this way, people will walk away. there are a hundred restaurants just like it in chinatown.",

    "i have been to lao 3 times because i had a good experience the first 2 times. i've also visited their new restaurant in uptown, and the sweet station (my 19 year old and her friends love it) and lao you ju in chinatown. my last experience at lao sze chuan was so bad that tony (hu the owner) has lost 2 stars from me. we arrived on a friday evening and were seated upstairs, no problem, until it was time to take our order. the waiter was not patient at all, with 300+ items on the menu, you would think he'd expect a few questions. he was being very short and you can feel the impatience. one of our friends finally said, just get me an order or crab rangoon, and i'll share whatever everyone else is having. i ordered something and asked if it had mushrooms, he said yes, and i said no mushrooms please. he didn't ask if we wanted drinks, and took off, we had to flag him down to order drinks. our meals all came at different times, about 5 10 minutes apart and we had to ask for rice. i got my meal and it had mushrooms, and the waiter expected me to keep it when i pointed out the mushrooms. i had to ask him to take it back. our crab rangoon came last, and was very cold. the waiter also kept disappearing. i don't think the waitstaff are held accountable for their tables after the order is taken because every dish was brought out by a different person, and our waiter never came back to check on us. we even had to flag him down to get our check. once the food came, it was ok. i think the waiting for it to come out one by one and the cold appetizer ruined our appetite. i was very disappointed, especially since i had talked it up to the 3 friends that were there with me. but like i said, i've been the two other times, and the service was better and i enjoyed the food (sze chaun chicken is great) so i might give it one more chance, hopefully they were just having a bad day. i just cant recommend it after my last visit.",

    "awful experience: so lets go to hot pot with two vegetarians, one i don't eat read meat and one eh vegetables aren't my favorite types. now then lets take our menus away and bring out a plate full of tripe, pounds of different kinds of meat, and a bunch of greens, maybe a few sweet potatoes. ugh it was awful, i'm used to being able to choose what is brought to your table. oh yeah and it cost 100 for four people because we got all this food we didn't eat. she just took our menus and gave us the hot pot sampler. saw a couple on teh way out with a sectioned dish (so you know we don't have to pick prawn antenna off our lettuce) and a few things they obviously got to pick and choose why couldn't we? awful experience.",

    "absolutely delicious spicy cuisine! this is coming from a person who truly enjoys all cuisines, as well as ghost peppers. i have dined here many times, and the one con that i keep coming up with is the service. i have worked in the industry for ten years and am married to a chef. i know the style of the establishment, and do not expect for any above and beyond hospitality from lao's. that being said, not only have i not been given what was ordered the past three times, but have been overcharged (charged for item that never came to the table) as well as lied to. this evening, while waiting for the chef's special chili chicken, i addressed the server to find out how much longer (as everyone in the party was completely finished with the rest of the dishes) only to have the server tell me that the food was coming, and then to actually see him enter the forgotten chicken into the computer. very disappointing. i then saw the same server eat his family meal while texting on his phone. he never came back to see if the chicken had arrived or if anyone in the party would like anything else. one of his colleagues dropped the check. the other frustrating part of the evening is that every single dish hit the table at exactly the same time, swamping the table with an array of cold and hot food, leaving much to be desired once finished with what should have been an appetizer moving on to what should have been a hot dish. to actually have to wait so long for one single dish, and then not have the server not admit error was unforgivable. no apology. no thank you for coming at the end of the meal. nothing. being that i come here at least twice a month, and the same staff is always working, and i am a generous tipper, i would expect some sort of gratitude, if not just getting the food that i actually ordered in a timely fashion with the appropriate check at the end of the meal. these are restaurant basics. i would love to continue patronizing this establishment, except for the fact that every single time i have brought a new person to dine, they have been completely and utterly dismayed by the service, or lack there of. i will maybe order take out from here if i am really craving something spicy, but i can say without a doubt, that i will no longer personally dine here ever again. should you try it? yes. the food is absolutely amazing. chef hu is a master of his craft, i just wish that he would hone the rest of his crew to some sort of acceptable front of house standard. please!",

    "when my family is in chicago, we always come here for dinner at least once. my mom is a great cook, and she'd never eat things she could cook better at home herself. but she loves this place! we usually get the spicy fish stew thing (shui zhu yu), eggplant in garlic sauce or pork in garlic sauce, beef noodle soup, and a wildcard or two, but always authentic szechuan dishes. everything is always very flavorful, and we always keep coming back for those particular 3, but i've never disliked anything we've tried as far as authentic food is concerned. can't speak for their americanized fare though. food comes out pretty fast, too, which is nice. the prices are very reasonable for the portions we almost never finish. unfortunately during their dinner hours it gets pretty hectic, and they are grossly understaffed for the rush period. this could mean waiting at the door for 5 10 minutes without being greeted though there is like an empty table of two you can sit down in, 5 10 when you're ready to order, needing to flag down frantic waitresses for anything you need during your meal, or waiting 10 minutes without a check even after chasing down said waitress a few times. just. don't go if you're in a hurry during dinner rush, or if you are expecting decent service. but i'd say the food is worth it if you don't mind.",

    "wah, after trying their hot pot, i am giving it one more star. we ordered a la carte: spicy and non spicy soup base, 2 plates of beef, 2 plates of beef balls,1 plate of tofu, 1 plate of wood ear, 1 plate of scallop, 1 plate of eggplant, 1 plate of baby bai chai, and 2 eggs. i split it with my friend and our sig. others got to taste too. it was more than filling. we polished everything off. everything was delicious in there. it came with 3 different sauces. i usually go for the xo sauce but i actually preferred the garlic one this time. it was perfect for that night because it was a little chilly out. i ate mostly from the non spicy side and my friend ate mostly from the spicy side. she was dying from the spice, haha, but she said it was worth it. we were so full afterwards yet after 15 minutes of resting we still went to get milk tea at saint's alp. the boys ordered 3 additional entrees: a chicken dish, pork intestines, and twice cooked pork belly. all were good, especially the twice cooked pork belly. though these dishes are from szechuan region, i did not think it was too spicy which is good for me because i can't handle too much spice. oh and we also ordered dumplings which worked out for my 3 year old son because that was pretty much all he ate. he loves dumplings. we came on a monday night around 7:30pm. it was not very busy. we did not have to wait and service was fast. also, this is my fav out of all of tony's gourmet group of restaurants. oh and next time, i would go for the deluxe hot pot special where you pay a flat fee 16.95 per person and get unlimited items. it is much more worth it, however, you cannot share with others unless they pay the flat fee as well. our boys wanted to order other things as well as try some of the hot pot, so that's why we did a la carte instead.",

    "i'll continue to attest that chicago does not have a great chinese restaurant. i've eaten at a couple of tony's restaurants and this one was by far the worst experience from a food perspective, it was borderline a nightmare. my girlfriend and i order takeout last night, we went with our usual order of sesame chicken, muu shu chicken, pot stickers, vegetable fried rice, and wanton soup. the wanton soup was average at best as the broth was excessively oily. the pot stickers were the highlight of the meals were excellent, plenty of filling and not super doughy. here's where it started going down hill, muu shu chicken was really sweet, but it wasn't terrible, but could definitely have been better. sesame chicken was really a let down as every other piece was 90% grizzle and fat. i also think they took the spice that was supposed to go in the chicken and dumped it into my rice . oh the vegetable fried rice my favorite part of dinner. it was inedible, i love spicy food and i have zero issues with really really spicy, but whoever made this rice must have taken the whole container of spice and dumped it in and then added a second container as well. overall for 55 i expect a much better meal and especially from a place that is considered one of the primer chinese restaurants in the area. pretty disappointed. probably the last time i'll be visiting one of these restaurants.",

    "i don't really see what the big deal about this place is.with the whole long wait.? i like spicy and this place does spicy but the flavor is kind of lacking.maybe we were ordering the wrong things? i came down from milwaukee hoping to get some great chinese/szechuan food since wisconsin is sort of lacking in that area.and i know great chinese food.i grew up in san fran.i think that, in itself, vouches for my review. house dried fried ribs: i've had better house fried ribs.way better.both in flavor and quality.the ribs they served us were filled with fat and barely any meat.basically low quality ribs. the seasoning was not all that great. i've had salt and pepper ribs that were better than this. lamb with cumin: this was basically lamb slices cooked covered in cumin spice and chili flakes/seeds, period. i think that was all they used to flavor the meat. each piece of lamb was covered in chili seeds and the cumin was too overpowering. there was so much cumin powder that i could literally see the seasoning and powder caked onto the meat. it needed a little more salt element to it also. mapo tofu: again.i've had way better mapo tofu. the tofu was served in pure chili oil, chilis and scallions.they was no sauce or flavoring that came with this. i could honestly have made this dish at home. buy some scallions, red chili oil, and silk tofu and toss it together.that was basically this dish.disappointing. i don't know.i just don't get it.someone tell me what to get here, maybe?.because i just don't get the big deal.at all. oh, but the host was entertaining.your typical chinese man with a loud hoarse voice.you could just tell he smokes a pack of cigs a day. haha.he was a character.",

    "i would love to give this place no stars if i could. having eating in chinatown easily over 100 times, this was far and away my worst dining experience for multiple reasons. the service was so dreadfully bad i honestly don't know where to begin. first, the host was some gentleman outside who had to be the the loudest and crudest doorman in restaurant history. i know most restaurants in this area don't have a first priority on service, but this guy was like a military sergeant. once we actually got inside, it literally took 30 minutes to just get us water and menus. then once our appetizers started arriving, we had to ask for utensils about 5 times before they could manage to bring over chopsticks. we were checked on zero times and if i wanted a refill on my water, i had to frantically wave down my waiter and pray he doesn't ignore me. we eventually found out there was a massive delay on water because they were out of cups. maybe this is acceptable where you dine, but if i'm going to be consuming spicy asian food, i'd like to have a glass of water. i really don't know where to start with the food. if you want to stop reading now, that is fine. just head right next door to ming hin where i guarantee you will have an excellent meal for about half the price in a much much nicer setting. we got the 3 chili chicken which everyone on yelp had been raving about. granted it was the only decent thing we got on the night, but by no means was it stellar. it was a decent chinese chicken dish that wasn't exemplary in the slightest. we got the hot pot which had a decent flavor, but the meat was pretty atrocious and bordeline inedible. we got a bunch of other dishes which were all mediocre at best. by far the biggest disappointment for me was the salt and pepper seafood dish. this dish contains shrimp, squid, and scallop for 14.95 and should have the signature chinese salt and pepper seasoning. if you want to have awesome salt and pepper seafood for literally half the price, walk a few doors down to chi cafe and you will be satisfied. the portion on this dish was incredibly small and lacked any flavor. i was with a party of eight and had been talking about this dish at other establishments. a few people in my group had never been to chinatown so i figured they would be wowed by this flavor. sure enough it was so poorly executed just like everything else on the night. i urge you to just go to ming hin next door or for even slightly cheap just hit up chi chi cafe. their food is so so much better and far cheaper.",

    "sichuan cuisine is a bit harder to find so i jump at the chance to try restaurants who specialize in it. found lao sze chaun through some research and reading bout tony hu. apparently this guy is the real deal and all the articles and awards on the windows of the restaurant were proud to let everyone know. went to dinner on a sunday at around 8pm and the place was pretty hoppin'. wait was only around 20 minutes and we ended up splitting a table with another couple (hey.whatever makes me eat faster). of course ordered the infamous chili chicken, watercress, dan dan noodles, and tea smoked duck. every single thing was absolutely delicious. the spicy, pickled cabbage given before your meal to munch on is a great preview of what's to come: spicy, addictive goodness. we got the chicken medium and i think anything else would have been dicey. the spiciness was perfect without being too painful. the chicken pieces were crunchy and delicious seasoned. bites of white rice (that is 1 a person.lame) and watercress helped cool things down.also the tea helps lots. the duck came with plum sauce and was a solid offering. a good counterpart to the spicier poultry. the dan dan noodles were alright, they came in a good sauce but lacked anything special. the restaurant itself is a funny balance of hu's global accomplishments and typical chinese restaurant. the decor is sleek and modern with blown up wallpapers of pandas. yes, the chairs are clear and kitschy. but the service and food is authentic.",

    "i have been looking for a good chinese restaurant since i never really developed an appreciation for chinese cuisine in general. sadly, this restaurant didn't help. they were out of the pea shoot dish, so we ordered the chinese broccoli and it was tasty. we also order chicken sizzling rice soup, which turned out to be inedible goop akin to pork and beans. yes, we ordered soup and, instead of broth, a bowl of liquid with the consistency of pork and beans arrived at our table. gross. we also got the fried chicken that comes with szechuan peppers. i didn't really care for the dish as it wasn't discernibly spicy, the chicken meat was almost non existent, and it was oilier than a little ceasar's pizza. there seemed to be a language barrier (even though i went with a person who spoke chinese) and the total bill topped 60 for lunch for two people.in chinatown. something is clearly wrong with that. from my visit on 12/29/11",

    "this place. oh, man. best chinese i've ever had. my stepdaughter is going to college in chicago and we went here last weekend while we were visiting her. i cannot wait to go again. i am sure we'll be back every time we visit her. i had a cow maw soup that was one of the freaking hottest things i have ever eaten. i love hot food but i'm a whitey, so i was sweating. the broth was un. believable. so,so delicious. the maw itself, i gotta admit, wasn't my thing, but i think that's just because i had hit my cultural limit. i don't fault the soup. my husband had the three cups chicken, tender and fantastic. my stepdaughter had the orang chicken, a standard, so probably not too interesting for the chefs to prepare, but it was really good. i gotta believe this is the best sichuan in chicago.",

    "great food, horrible service. it's pretty much the worst restaurant service i've ever experienced. i did realize that when it comes to chinatown restaurants, service is usually not that excellent to begin with, but my experience was that bad. i went with a party of 14 and the following things happened: the first dish came out by itself (and nothing else came out for a good 10 minutes), no rice until we flagged the server multiple times, the last dish came out after everything else was finished, and i had to go up to the register to get the check after waiting for 10+ minutes. i mean, seriously? i have been to lao sichuan before and the service was acceptable, but i got a table downstairs then. i heard that the service upstairs is horrible, and apparently it's not just a rumor. if you're planning to go to this place, get a table downstairs. if it wasn't for the food, i would give this place a 1 star without a doubt.",

    "very popular and usually crowded szechuan style resto, located at the western end of the chinatown square mall. lao sze chuan is the beginning and the linchpin of the small tony hu restaurant empire of several different lao restaurants, each specializing in a different chinese regional cuisine (lao beijing, lao shanghai, etc.). <a href=/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.chicagomag.com%2fchicago magazine%2fmarch 2012%2f100 most powerful chicagoans tony hu%2fands=84c18365fcdb0ebb3a1baf5a61817ec685f1faf19233db9f6feb353a78160823 target=_blank rel=nofollow>chicagomag.com/chicago m.</a> lao sze chuan is where i get my spicy, peppery, blazing hot tongue on. i started with the really tasty and refreshing (and free!) appetizer of cold shredded raw cabbage, in a fiery hot pepper sauce. this salad is nothing short of amazing. i could eat it all day, it's peppery enough to make your hair sweat. i then had a small bowl of wonton soup, which was a nice, salty, almost bland counterpoint to the fire cabbage. it was chock full of pork filled wontons, beautifully al dente, with an interesting and welcome note of ginger in the filling. the broth was rich and flavorful, which is sometimes not the case with this soup at other places. my main dish was lamb with cumin shredded wok fired pieces of tender lamb spiced up with red pepper and, not surprisingly, cumin. along with the lamb were onions, garlic cloves, pieces of fragrant ginger, dried red hot chilis, sliced green hot chilis and chunks of red bell pepper. i also ordered a dish of mixed szechuan vegetables in a thin non peppery sauce, with baby corn, onions, cooked cabbage, bamboo shoots and other healthy goodies. the veggies were the perfect yin balance to the yang nature of the cumin lamb. though i didn't order this on my latest meal at lao sze chuan, another dish i've really enjoyed here in the past is the chicken with dried red chilis, a spectacular flavor explosion on a platter. all told, the spicy cabbage salad, wonton soup, lamb with cumin, mixed szechuan vegetables, bowl of steamed rice, several pots of tea, a fortune cookie and many necessary glasses of ice cold water to put out the chili fires was 29.75 plus tip. and i carried enough leftovers home for another terrific meal the next day. the waitstaff here has always been friendly and efficient, even extending to the nice greeting and farewell from the hostess, but this place is way too busy to expect fawning service. you won't have a waiter anticipating your every move, but on the other hand, assistance always seems to be there for the asking.",

    "woke up from day drinking on saturday at 9:45pm to find that we had missed the music festival that we had been pregaming for altogether and that we were intensely hung over. fastforward 20 minutes of searching on yelp and a cab ride, and we find ourselves at lao sze chuan. being hung over, we ordered the following: xiao long bao mapo tofu sizzling rice soup with chicken hot pot combination(for two) .oh and two tsing tao beers. considering the sheer number of dishes we ordered and the normal serving size of this place, the amount of food that we got was completely ridiculous. but, everything was really good. i especially loved the sizzling rice soup and the mapo tofu. i had also been craving hot pot, so it was great. the hot side of the combination is really hot. being asian, i had heard rumors that it would be hot before, but i underestimated other people's tolerances for spice, trusting my asian upbringing to be above it all.to a certain degree i guess it helped, but at one point i tried to drink a spoon of the spicy part of the soup and died. the only con would be that i would have loved to be able to order just one order of the hot pot and share it because we had gotten so many other dishes, but they insisted that we could not share.so we got two and did not finish nearly half our food",

    "first of all the service is hit or miss at this place. but it doesn't matter to me because the food is that good. this place has the best chinese food i've ever eaten, gave me my taste for spicy food, and always leaves me satisfied. living in chicago i would hit up lao's for lunch at least once a month, and almost every time i had a visitor in town we would end up here for a meal. i've since moved, but when i'm in town i try to make it to the restaurant and often bring tupperware containers in my carry on suitcase to take some food back with me. when my friends from virginia find out i'm going to chicago they automatically start placing their orders from lao's. that's how much we love the food. i can't testify to the hot pot because i've never had it. i happen to be a big fan of the spicy cabbage they serve you at the beginning of the meal, and yes it is very spicy. i always always get the don don noodles, spicy noodle dish that is just heavenly. some other favorites include dry chili chicken, spicy crispy eggplant with ground pork, lamb with cumin, and tony's special three chili chicken. i almost never order americanized chinese food here although i have had the beef with broccoli and the moo shu beef which are both good. their pork pot stickers are also delicious. as another reviewer mentioned, make sure you order one of the more authentic dishes. you can get americanized chinese anywhere but i've never had better authentic chinese cuisine anywhere else. and believe me i've looked! get over the extra charge for rice. the food is worth it!",

    "such a rockin' experience for my first time in chinatown! i brought a bottle of wine only to find that byob was a 10 corkage but they do serve beer and wine, so knock yourself out! the menu is huge. it's basically impossible to know what to get, so ask your server, point at random, or try to pick whatever you're in the mood for? portions are big and i could nearly see our server giggling as we ordered three dishes instead of two apparently one per person is enough. you'll have leftovers, undoubtedly, if you order more than that. we munched on spicy cabbage (a very tasty table snack!) as we perused. garlic chinese broccoli, salt and pepper three delight, and mongolian beef tenderloin (i think?) were our three choices. all were large portions, all tasty and different. the broccoli had wonderful garlic flavor with a fresh taste not greasy and a welcome vegetable to cut through the rest of the meal! the seafood was lightly fried and delicately crisp (fairly mild flavor). the beef was soft and succulent, served in a broth loaded with pepper flakes (you can select how spicy you want it). couldn't come close to finishing; our server seemed to take pity on us and for no apparent reason gave my friend another beer on the house. very friendly of them! the food here is delicious and fresh, nothing like the greasy chinese food you grew up eating! i'd be tempted to return here again before trying another restaurant in chinatown, because lao sze chuan rocks pretty darn hard!",

    "hmm.i'm torn with this review because we had a hot pot dinner that was delicious and filled with meats, seafood, and veggies. unfortunately, we both got sick after eating the dinner. what is bizarre is that the stomach problems did not hit us until later the next day. i have a sensitive stomach that usually is affected quickly and within a few hours from dirty or bad food. i'm not quite sure why we both suffered stomach problems. but the hot pot was really delicious that i am thinking about going back and hoping for the best (no stomach problems the next time!). we'll have to see.more updates later. if you're thinking about doing the hot pot, i recommend getting the deluxe hot pot with half regular broth/half spicy broth. the spicy broth is pretty spicy so unless you can handle it, i suggest doing the half and half. the food that comes with the deluxe hot pot is fish balls, meat balls, veggies, mussels, shrimp, beef, tofu, tripe, fish, and bean curd. the hot pot includes six garnish/spices of garlic in oil, cilantro, green onion, hot chili, and two other things we did not use. cost is 17 per person, but after taxes and tip costs around 24 per person.",

    "this little place was recently featured on check please, so if you go, prepare for a wait. also, this is in an outdoor shopping mall, so plan to wait outside! that said, it's totally worth the wait. food was delicious and the menu offers a load of options, including a decent number of vegetarian options. the staff is friendly if a bit harried, and i think we completely lost our waitress for a while there, but the meal was excellent. my only complaint is that the staff seemed a tad disorganized, and that i would swear we received the wrong dish. we ordered ginger chicken and the chicken dish we received (among several others) didn't appear to have any ginger in it (despite a confirmation from a passing waiter that it was indeed ginger chicken). still totally worth it. there's plenty of parking around there (metered), and you can wander around the mall while you wait (or digest).",

    "i thought lao sze chuan was a great experience it was my first time eating in chinatown! so i guess take that for what it's worth i eat tons of chinese food, but random places in my neighborhood (andersonville) and i do eat at corporate places like pf changs. but with that said.i grew up on south indian food, so i am not completely unfamiliar with authentic asian cuisines. we got here about 6:00 on a saturday night we got a number at the door, and the line moved pretty quickly. we sat down and ordered our appetizer (eggrolls amazing) and got water and tea (also good). the waitress gave us a complimentary appetizer of spicy cabbage, which it appears is the standard. it is very good, but very spicy. like your lips feel like they are burning off spicy. i'm part indian, so i tried to fight through it and eat it all. then came time to order our dinner. per yelp reviews, we chose the chili chicken. my husband also picked a cashew chicken. the cashew chicken was excellent very tasty, great sauce, yummy mushrooms with it, etc. the chili chicken was just okay i guess we left about half of it on the table. service seems to be similar to others'. our waitress took our order and then we never saw her again. but, we were taken care of by others working in the restaurant, so i guess whatever works. i would definitely recommend this place the food was good and it's a unique experience. i did not give it a 5 because i think i need to give it another try and try a different meal, and not od on the spicy cabbage! i also need to see what the difference (besides the location, clientele, and atmosphere) is from this restaurant, and others i have been to throughout the city.",

    "erm, how about noooo. perhaps we ordered poorly (spicy eggplant, egg roll appetizer, jumbo shrimp appetizer, and governor's chicken), but it was all meh. the appetizers were too doughy. the spicy eggplant was not spicy enough, as far as i was concerned, though the caramelized garlic sauce it was sauteed in was good, but nothing mind blowing. i ended up making my own dish by dousing my rice with the sauce and adding the jumbo shrimps to it. oh, and they charge you 1 for a bowl of rice, which i did see on listed on the menu, so i was forewarned, but you're not asked if you want rice with your meal, it's just assumed that you do, if you order a non noodle dish, and then you're charged for it. where i come from (houston) the asian restaurants do not charge for rice that accompanies non noodle dishes. that, to quote tony harrison, is an outrage: <a href=/redir?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dybcq8xdgrp0ands=95dda010485f6147b5cdb4c7a9f80d299512e0a766f971ce63d18a9f42a46084 target=_blank rel=nofollow>youtube.com/watch?v=ybcq.</a> we were initially enthused about this place: hole in the wall, in chinatown, a queue of people waiting and hoping for their number to be called by the harried, cheongsam wearing hostess. instead, our visit brought to mind the dulcet harmonies of that public enemy song, don't believe the hype. not only was the food unremarkable, the service was borderline atrocious ( i know it's chinatown, i don't expect kowtowing, i don't even expect full acknowledgement until i have to flag you down, but even after i've flagged you down, you disappear), and the restaurant itself was hot, stuffy, and poorly ventilated. the decor details of panda photos and faux starck chairs did little to distract from these faults. once we escaped, we promptly headed to aji ichiban for some asian candies to make up for this mistake.",

    "i'm not a chinese food connoisseur, but i thought lao sze chuan was authentic and had a nice atmosphere. this is a extremely busy place on a saturday evening, which is when we went. some reviewers mentioned you can call ahead to be placed on their wait list. i will definitely give that a try the next time. a little heads up, they will bring a spiced cabbage starter to your table. it is very spicy. i really enjoy spicy food, but this made my lips burn for at least an hour. i will likely avoid the cabbage starter on the next trip. for the main course we ordered the dry chili chicken and cashew chicken. the dry chicken chili was labeled extra spicy, but it was not nearly as hot as the cabbage starter. the dry chicken chili was ok, in my opinion. as other reviewers stated, the chicken was a little overcooked. i really enjoyed the cashew chicken. the chicken was cooked perfectly and the veggies and mushrooms were amazing. i have one dislike: our waitress went missing. she served us our appetizers and took our orders and disappeared after that. random waiters/waitresses refilled our beverages, cleared our dirty dishes and got us our check. i sure hope she (missing waitress) is okay.",

    "another great find in chinatown. my mexican friend suggested this to me. there is no malice in that sentence. i have a lot of mexican friends but i've been to chinatown a gazillion times, with a gazillion different friends and never been introduced to this place. parking was plentiful at about 5:30pm. ordered: tony's chicken with 3 chili and the crispy shrimp in lemon sauce (suggested by the waiter after i asked). i loved both choices. dislike: slow service my friend tried tony's chicken before so she knew it was good and yes it was. crispy, spicy, a hint of sweet peppers and very addictive. the shrimp was really good too. crispy lemon flavor whole shrimps. after doing some more research on this restaurant, i discovered lsc is part of tony gourmet group and there are other restaurant bearing same names lao beijing and lao shanghai which i will definitely check out too. next time i patron lsc, i will have the chef's special dry chili chicken as i see lots of customers love it as well. it looks similar to tony's chicken but without the sweetness. can't wait to go back!",

    "this is the place to go in chinatown if you want authentic schezuan food. disclaimer: do not take someone here on the first date, unless you know for a fact that the other person thinks sweating is a turn on. i spent half the meal with my tongue hanging half out of my mouth like a fucking dog in summer. the restaurant serves a free spicy cabbage appetizer that will already be too spicy for roughly 95% of the white people who mistakenly find themselves in here. the issue is not how hot each dish is individually. what's really emotionally taxing is the fact that the spice builds on itself, until your ears are bright red, you're using your napkin to dab the pool of sweat at the small of your back, and you're talking like you've got a speech impediment because your mouth is contradictorily both numb and all feeling at the same time. we split a dry chili chicken and a spicy crispy eggplant. i would recommend both, but the dry chili chicken is something you will both love and fear for months to come. don't be a pussy and try this place out.",

    "i'm currently obsessed with this restaurant. it's one of the best chinese restaurants i've been to. (i've been to lots of restaurants in china, macau, hong kong and taiwan) this one is definitely the best i've been to in chicago and in my top 4 5 all time. do: order the authentic chinese / sichuan items come during off peak hours exhibit some patience, since service isn't the best drink lots of water dont: don't order the americanized chinese / everyday chinese items. i.e. beef broccoli, mongolian beef, orange chicken, sesame chicken, lemon chicken, fried rice, lo mein. these dishes are prepared, cooked, and taste pretty much the same in every chinese restaurant in america. dishes i've tried: boiled beef with szechuan sauce 5 fantastic, very spicy, ask for it less spicy sliced pork with garlic sauce 5 cold sliced pork belly with chili oil and garlic probably one of the best dishes i've had all year. very rich. 3 cups chicken 5 delicious braised chicken love the sauce and the fried basil leaves. lamb with cumin 4 good, lamb could be more tender chili prawns (dry) 4 good, simple, nice sized prawns chili chicken (dry) 4 good, simple, spicy i can't wait to try some more of the items on the menu. next on my list is lao hunan. but needless to say, this restaurant has re invigorated my interest in chinese food. good stuff.",

    "i wasn't going to review this place until i'd been more than once, but i figure it's taken me years to get there; who knows when i'll get back? the place was busy when we got there and within a few minutes of being seated people were lined up out the door. to be honest, nothing i tried quite convinced me that waiting in line for this place was worth it. the spicy cabbage that comes to the table gratis was tasty but much hotter than i liked. never mind that, you can't like everything in a restaurant, right? the pot stickers that we split as an appetizer were excellent; really tasty. i opted for one of my favorite dishes, twice cooked pork. the menu said fat and honestly, i should have paid attention to that warning, but i'd had the dish many times before and it usually had a nice edge of fat which could easily be removed before eating the lean part. well not at lao sze chuan. the pork was 60% fat and 40% lean. it had the right amount of heat, and was made with leeks instead of cabbage and scallions the way i'm used to eating it. that change didn't make too much difference to me, but the fat was a problem. also a problem was the fact that the dish was way too salty. not i can't eat this salty, but far saltier than i like (and i like the stuff.) my dinner companions were disappointed that i was not enjoying my meal, but it happens. i could've sent it back and said too salty but i'd still have gotten a plate of fat in return. i figured, why bother? i did taste the dry chili chicken and it was very good, and the pig elbow one of the specials of the day which was tasty, too. the service was so so. the dishes came out with big lags between each, presumably because it's expected that you'll share your food, but if that's the case they should ask first. it would have been much nicer if we could all have eaten our entrees at the same time. so why three stars? because: 1) i should have paid attention to the menu. it was my fault that my entree was unpalatable because of the fat. the salt was their fault, but it was kind of a minor thing by comparison. 2) the other things i tried were tasty. 3) our waiter really did try very hard. when i go back, i'll do an update. i hope the star level will go up. i suspect it will.",

    "my mother came to visit me in the city the other day. considering she had never even come to visit once in college or ever for that matter. this was kind of surprising. naturally, i took her to chinatown. there's endless choices in chinatown. we settled for lao sze chuan because i had never been before and have heard good things. plus, dimsum is pretty much the same everywhere so if you're looking for a place to get delicious chinese dishes outside the usual dimsum style then this is a good option. it's hidden on the end of the strip. it's pretty pricey, about 12 14 per dish, but the food was really good and authentic. easily shared. the spicy bamboo shoots that come free at the beginning of your meal are spicy. beware, it'll make your palette numb. i don't really know the english names for the dishes we ordered, so i'll do my best. the garlic with chinese veggie (gonshing chai) was delicious and brings me back to childhood. light and not too salty, it was a good palette cleanser since everything else was pretty spicy. the fish filets in chili sauce was delicious. not overly spicy and great over white rice. the 3 cups chicken is a must order. so good, the sauce is a bit sweet and the chicken falls off the bones. reminds me of the 3 cup chicken i ate in taiwan. i will order this every time. the noodles were forgettable. the don don noodles were just ok, the sauce was a bit salty. the wonton soup wasn't very good either. i've made better at home. the whole dish was very bland and the wontons were ordinary. i'd skip these. overall though, it was a really good meal and i'm glad we chose this over dimsum. again, dimsum is pretty much the same everywhere you go, although delicious. if you want traditional family style shared plates, then lao sze chuan is a great option. note though, the menu is like a book so it helps to have someone that knows how to order come with. the waitress was rude. my mom tried to order something off memory and instead of just saying they don't have that dish, the waitress was like 'do you see that in the menu? please show me cuz it's not on there.' umm ok then, unnecessary but this is as expected in chinatown i suppose.",

(picture attached) maybe it's their own take on it, but to me it was a fail. dish 2: spicy fish filet with pickled veggies this dish was super sour and not nearly spicy enough, not even to the americanized spicy level. now some sourness is expected because of the pickled veggies, but here it was so overwhelming that i had to neutralize every bite with a mouthful of rice. yet another fail for me. perhaps i should have stuck to the signature dishes like spicy stewed beef or twice cooked pork. but the dishes i tried did not live up to the good reviews or level of authenticity expected.",

    "i still dream about the food from lao sze chuan! the biggest pro tip i can give you is to go with your friend, who is from szechuan! my friend knew exactly what to order and we were so pleased. so here's what to order! all of which can in sum, be called tasty! non spicy: szechuan string beans (good garlic flavor to them) seafood tofu soup (plain delicious) spicy (but really not that spicy if you're used to spicy): chef's special sole fish fillet with tofu chef's special dry chili chicken (i'm addicted to this.) ma po tofu stewed eggplant hometown style note that szechuan spice is different from other spices in that it hits you hard upon first taste, and is a little sweet. however, this restaurant does an amazing job of bringing out different flavor profiles in the spices that veer more towards savory. as for ambiance, the chairs are a little uncomfortable because they are plastic, but i admire that they have the restaurant's logo on them. in addition, the second floor seating area is very cold, but the downstairs is too warm. choose your temperature battle. they also have a full bar.",

    "right in china town square, this was a great place for lunch or dinner. went there with a friend on a weekday afternoon. we were seated right away. had a really good complimentary tea. we had fried rice, three chilli chicken, and general tso's chicken. the portions were very generous, the chicken was cooked perfectly! good use of spices and seasonings on the fried rice. the only negatives i found were a dirty table cloth,slow service, an extra charge for white rice and dated decor. but the great meal made up for all those things! am defiantly going back to try the peking duck, heard its suppose to be the best in chicago!",

    "best chinese food in chicago! i have to admit that chinese is not my cuisine of choice, but i have eaten enough of the greasy practically fast food variety to know that lao sze chuan is the real deal. it's deceivingly good, despite the medium grade (at best) decorations and walls full of cheap panda images. fortunately the food speaks for itself. and when it does, it says eat me! i'm delicious! and relatively cheap! i almost stopped after the complimentary plate of spicy cabbage damn near sent me to the hospital. easy on the intake, one red pepper flake to the back of the throat and your meal could be over. but i powered through and managed to gorge myself on a feast of: cashew shrimp (so yummy!) friend noodles w. shrimp (great balance of sauce / noodles / shrimp) ma po tofu (super spicey, but with the right blend of rice it balanced out nicely) eggplant in garlic sauce (didn't love the texture, but the garlic sauce was delicious) the other two diners with me also got a chicken dish, which i didn't eat (but they liked) the whole meal only cost us 60 and there were tons of leftovers. i will absolutely be back here again. worth noting we got here around 1pm on a saturday and had a 10 minute wait for 3 people. by 1:30pm, the line was out the door.",

    "excellent, top of the line authentic chinese. there is nothing glamorous or glitzy about it, simply exceptional food. started with egg rolls and pot stickers. the egg rolls were solid, pot stickers were fantastic, the pork was very tasty. the mongolian beef was amazing; i definitely would double up on this next time. we also had tony's three way chicken which was crispy, garlicky and delicious. veggie fried rice was very good. the only dish that we really didn't enjoy was the moo shoo chicken, something about the flavor just wasn't appealing. the table next to us was plowing through an order of it though so that might have just been personal preference. i know many of the negative reviews are for poor service but that was not my experience at all. we sat down right away, attentive servers and we were served quickly. if your looking for authentic chinese, definitely hit up lao sze chaun.",

    "after driving around in circles several times for parking, we finally decided on eating the cost and parking in the lot. when we arrived, there were several groups waiting outside in 35 degree weather. everyone was here for the same reason to dine at the highly publicized and notorious lao sze chuan. this place is infamous as seen by the many awards and media coverage it has received shown at the front window of the restaurant. business has been going well since they expanded to the second floor and renovated the interior and exterior of the space. i remember the food being excellent when it first opened but is it just as good now that i have to wait an hour before being seated? we ordered the shrimp in mayonnaise sauce, noodles peking style, and curry chicken. the shrimp is outstanding and as good as i remembered it. it's definitely a must have. at other places, it's normally dense and you feel like you just ate spoonfuls of mayonnaise. at lao sze chuan, it's more refined where the batter and sauce are light with a citrus aftertaste. i come specifically for this dish even though they specialize in szechuan cuisine. lao sze chuan is still worth all of the hype but the wait is aggravating for dining in chinatown. it's bad enough that you have to fight for parking and the food takes some time to come out. for city folk, take the red line to avoid parking expenses. for drivers, avoid peak times to save your sanity. since they are open until 2:30am, i would definitely come back again but maybe try off times to avoid the crowds.",

    "if all the dictators, terrorists, violent criminals, and rosie o' donnell sat down to a 20 course meal by lao sze chuan.the world would be a much better place. lao sze chuan is soulful, spicy, comforting, authentic, and super good. located on a perfect corner in china town, one can take in china town for a while if there's a lengthy wait. or you can just stroll around this interesting cultural area to help your food digest. the interior is busy, bright, and full of amazing smells. for the food, i can only speak for a few items. these items however, are outlandish. the dried chili chicken is almost unsharable. it's so good i want to eat it all. leftovers? not possible, you'll eat em' in the car or as a late night snack. or your significant other or family members will find out about it and it erase it's existence. their mapo tofu is hella spicy and will punch you in the face with flavor. lao has ruined suburb chinese for me, but i'm happy it did. i was continually getting burned by these chinese restaurants that are unauthentic and forced to appease the american pallet. most of the dishes at these kinds of places are loaded with cornstarch, and everything is unbearably breaded. thank you lao sze chuan. next time i go to here, it's gonna be tough not ordering the same thing. but i'm excited to try all the other great items they have to offer.",

    "we ordered the famous spicy chicken, the fried duck and the mapo tofu. my thoughts on each: spicy chicken: this is unbelievably hot. once you see the dish, you'll see that this is obvious by how many peppers are on the plate. the weird thing is, it's not the same type of heat you would receive from most hot foods. i would classify it as a dry heat that kind of keeps burning inside. however, it is very, very addicting and i couldn't stop picking at the plate to find bits and pieces we had not eaten. fried duck: one of the most delicious pieces of duck that i have ever had. if you love fried chicken or duck in general, you should not pass on an opportunity to try the duck here. the duck is cooked perfectly and i had to have my friend restrain me from eating the bones. mapo tofu: once again, lsc does not mess around when they tell you a dish is spicy. this compounded with the fact that we had already eaten the aforementioned chicken probably burned a hole in our stomachs. however, that just means that we just have tofu bits floating in our bodies which i'm pretty sure is okay because tofu is healthy. so if all this food was so good, why is it only getting 4 stars? well for one, the food comes out unbelievably slow. i understand food service can be slow at times, especially when the restaurant is packed, but there were empty tables there (3:30 pm). it took us about an hour for us to get all of our dishes. i can't imagine how long it would have taken if we came during a normal dining hour. the other con is that their portion sizes look big at first, but they are actually smaller than you expect. just be prepared to drink a lot of water. recommendation: for the faint of heart fried duck, for the bold spicy chicken",

    "one of my favorite restaurants in chicago! the food is amazing traditional chinese food, so you can get everything from spring rolls to kidneys here. the menu is huge, and the food is spicy and yummy. i will get 4 people's worth of delivery, and eat it for an entire weekend sometimes. the chef's specials are all good, and not too adventurous for the squeamish, but some hidden gems: all the eggplant dishes, the dumplings, the veggies. the hot pot is also great. if you're not familiar with the concept, it's like broth fondue where you cook all kinds of veggie and meat in boiling broth at the table, and then you can cook noodles in it if you want. this may not be the best dish to share with people you don't know that well because you all share the same broth. do this with close friends.",

    "my visit to lao sze chuan was prompted by it's michelin bib gourmand rating. it was my first trip to chinatown, and my first experience with authentic chinese food. two things i've been dying to try are peking duck, and hot pot. the peking duck was delicious. they served it a bit cold though. a server also served up all the duck wrapped in flour tortillas with a sauce and onions. i found that i preferred the duck itself with some cracklin and sauce. the hot pot didn't live up to my expectations for heat, but the flavor was amazing especially with the white fish and lamb. the very chinese section of the menu looked very interesting, and i look forward to returning to explore it. i almost want to hold out my review until i do. service was a bit awkward, but i chalk that up to my white ass being outside of my cultural comfort zone, and not a knock on the restaurant itself.",

    "new years day, my family and i wanted to try something new, so we pop up on yelp and see the great reviews for this place, so we decided to try it. the place was packed and understandable so we made a reservation and explored the area while we were waiting to be called, so we're in the gift shop across the street when the manager comes yelling in at us for not picking up the phone, so they sent us upstairs where we stood outside in the cold while no one came to open the door for us until a nice customer of the restaurant had to stand up from his seat to open it for us. so the waiter look baffled as we walk in like we didn't belong there, then after he guides us to our seats, we sit for a long period of time before they brought us our menus lol. now that was just what we saw in their service lets go on to food. we looked around in the old broken menus for a while and decided to pick their deluxe hotpot special, thinking that trying something new might be interesting so we wait over half an hour for our dinner to come out, back you wouldn't have guess what dish came out first. our desert idk why they would even do that our appetizers came out some time after, so we left the desert lying around. the appetizers were average compared to other restaurants we've eaten at so not much to say there. so during all of this we were humored by their staff which i could have sworn did not know proper english except for our first waiter who we could see did not want to be there. we never got a proper bottle of soy sauce and chili pepper sauce which we actually got up and asked for. in a chinese restaurant for real? okay so there other problems whit the service which i could go on rambling about but lets go to the main course. the hotpots came out, we tasted the stock in the pot, it was below average tasted kinda bland. the raw seafood and vegetables came out looked liked a regular setup for a hotpot meal, cooked up the seafood and vegetables and tried it. the seafood tasted old especially the mussels and squid. there was some positives about the meal i got to try some new items like fish meatballs and bamboo which tasted pretty good, but we didn't trust their vegetables. the meats came out, the beef was mostly fat tasted hard and old. the lamb after it was cooked tasted pretty much like beef with a bit more texture nothing special there. oh yeah almost forgot about the sauces they did give us, my recommendation to you don't try it garlic sauce was terrible smelled like my old science fair project no lie. the barbecue sauce had some hard precipitate in it, tasted expired. they looked like they just came out of the freezer so we ate everything bland no sauce and never got that soy sauce. we ate the cold desert and so they brought us the bill. about 300 great they even included the tip ( which they did not deserve), way too overpriced and to end things off they didn't give us enough fortune cookies :) never coming back here again.",

    "lao sze chuan is one of my favorite chinese restaurants based on the quality of the food alone. there is not a lot to distinguish most restaurants in chinatown for ambiance, theatrics or for that matter flavors so their direct take on szechuan cuisine is why i like it so much. i tried their house special hot and sour soup for the first time. for a totally vegetarian version, this soup was rich, flavorful and surprisingly complex. crumbled peanut mixed into the soup was a yummy twist. their dry chili chicken is still my must have dish. lightly breaded crispy coated, tender chicken, all spicy and salty. this would be so good in a bucket with a beer while watching a movie. the mongolian lamb was an excellent second dish. one of our friends ordered the kung pao shrimp, not exactly szechuan but still very well executed. like most chinese restaurants, the dessert options are lacking to non existent but if you know this ahead of time, there are places for bubble tea like joy yee just a few doors over and they have something like 80+ sweet options on their drink list. this was a relaxing meal after my group had spent the day at the museum of science and industry. today was a good food day, the meal was just perfect.",

    "if you're ever in chinatown, make it a priority to stop at lao sze chuan. it is easily one of the best chinese restaurants in the whole city. everything is good at lao sze schuan. like the name implies, the food originates from the sichuan province in china. they are known to like their spices, so obviously lao sze chuan specializes in very, and i mean very spicy. the restaurant is two levels, and both levels are pretty spacious. the service is not good here, but don't expect good service at chinese restaurants, only expect good food and fast service. you can order your typical americanized chinese food like mongolian beef, sesame chicken, general tso's, etc, and it is very good, but they have a ton of authentic sichuan, as well as mandarin and cantonese food. i love their dim sum. their house noodles come in a broth with chunks of ground meat, along with some spinach, and noodles. it comes with a little kick, and you can ask for it to be spicier if you'd like. the sesame chicken i've had here, is the best i've ever had. the fried rice is always tasty, i love their egg rolls as well as their pot stickers. don't be afraid to try anything here, unless you do not like spicy food. even their spicy cabbage appetizer they bring you is delicious. for the best chinese food in the city, come to lao sze chuan. they offer very good portions for their prices, and have the most consistently delicious chinese food i've ever had. 5/5 head down over to joy yee noodle for a smoothie afterwards, if you saved some room that is.",

    "i had high hopes for this place because it gets rave reviews but i don't know if it was as good as i expected. it's possible we came on an off day, but i just wasn't terribly impressed. i came here with my family and we had szechaun style sliced beef and maw, hot and sour soup (both the regular and house versions), sole fish fillet with pickled cabbage in spicy soup, yu shiang pork, garlic sauteed peapod greens, spicy lamb satay, and a sweet eggplant dish. the sliced beef and maw was a really great appetizer. it's one of my favorite cold dishes and i think they did it really well here. it was spicy and had a good dose of si chuan peppercorns. the fish soup was also pretty good. it didn't look spicy at all, but there were a ton of pepper seeds in it and also heavily seasoned with white ground pepper. the lamb satay was pretty standard but a little dry. plus it was really expensive for a tiny bit of what is essentially street food in china. the disappointment was the yu shiang pork. it was listed as one of the house specials and that got my dad excited because this is his favorite dish (he's from si chuan) and always orders it as an indication of whether a restaurant is good. it wasn't bad, but he didn't like that it wasn't authentic. i don't care about authenticity usually as long as it's good, but i have to say it was too sweet for me too. the servers were nice and spoke great mandarin and english, which is always a plus, but service was kind of spotty still. there was a line out the door when we got there (which is how my dad decided we should eat here), and it was unclear who was taking names and how we were supposed to go about putting a name in. we were finally seated upstairs and that was kind of weird because it was really quiet and there was no music or any ambient noise. also, we ordered an additional dish halfway through the meal and had to wait almost a half hour after we were done eating for that to show up. i think they just forgot to make it and when we asked if we could cancel it, they made it up really quick and told us we couldn't cancel it because it was already made. plus there is a boss ish guy with a huge diamond stud earring that was intimidating even though he wasn't unpleasant exactly. i want to come back here and give this place another chance. i got outvoted on twice cooked pork and tea smoked duck, which are my indicators. so i'll probably be back to try those here, but not because of having a great experience the first time.",

    "oh lao sze chuan. you were once my favorite spot in chinatown. but i will never come back. i came here with my family and we were shoved in the back room upstairs, which was filled with cigar smoke, presumably from the diamond studded manager. said manager was fond of yelling at the top of his cigar smoke filled lungs. our waitress left 5 min after arriving for her shift maybe he yelled at her too. now that i've set the stage, let us discuss the food. first, there was hair in the spicy cabbage. a dark, real human hair. gagging ensued. next, we were not provided with soup bowls or spoons. said soup was bland and cold. we were brought spring rolls with no sauce. and there were still veins in the shrimp an absolute sanitary no no. the rest of the food was just average. service was terrible. as i mentioned, our waitress left right after starting her shift. so the other waiters came over every so often as time permitted. the timing of the food was poor; most of the time we were waiting around and then we were slammed with food. and even after we received the food, we were always waiting around for something else. very annoying. the final straw was having a family member trip over a bus pan that was left in the hallway on the floor. they've been in business way too long to be such a disaster. what the heck happened to this place?",

    "made what i believe is our third trip to lao sze chuan last weekend, and again, i was quite pleased. prior to heading up to chicago for the weekend, i phoned 24 hours in advance to order the peking duck (this is a requirement). after seeing these ducks hanging in the window throughout chinatown during our last visit, i felt the need to partake. it always reminded me of atari's adventure game where the dragons(ducks) were killed by the arrow and their neck were broken and they just hung there lifeless. sadly, the ducks are not brought out in this fashion as i had hoped, instead they are sliced up into little bite sized squares. this actually was fairly upsetting as i really wanted to stand up and yell out one land, one sword, one king! and then slice his head off and chuck it across the room. the waiter actually prepares the duck for you by placing some sauce into a tortilla typed shell and then adding the duck, green onions and then folding it over to eat like a burrito. although it wasn't presented in the manner that i had expected, the taste was exquisite. the wife and i finished off the meal which is perfect for two people and at about 28 dollars, it wasn't too expensive. not something that we'll order every time we head to chicago, but since it was my wife's birthday, i splurged.",

    "let me open this review by saying quite honestly, i have eaten here probably more than 20 times. out of all those times i've dined here, there have been 2 times that were simply horrible. not bad. horrible. one of them was today. (feel free to skip actual details and f fwd to the bottom bits) i've had the dry chili chicken more times than i am willing to admit, and usually it is simply magnificent chicken bits crisply fried into a frenzy of heated spice with ginger and garlic riding shotgun into a forehead sweating terror of joy and bliss but today it was the most rubbery fatty oozing with greasy and undercooked ness i could have imagined. mongolian beef ok, i agree, this is a somewhat normal pedestrian dish, but usually, these 'normal' dishes are simply amazing versions of what you get elsewhere today, the dish was literally sitting in more oil than is in my car's engine. the entire dish was quite literally underwater in oil. not sauce/juice oil. needless to say, every attempt to keep this oil at bay was impossible, and every bite was indeed a cascade of luke warm sesame oil. the oil run off from this dish would be enough to power a bio diesel school bus for a month. i won't even bother to continue to list the dishes we ordered, and didn't eat. i feel it necessary to add that, over the several years i've been dining here, it is incredibly rare that any of the waitstaff has been able to answer even the most banal of queries. i can understand that in a start up type situation, somewhat untrained or un fluent english speaking is fairly par for the course, i can let it slide for a while. but at this point in time, we are years into this place, and it is very hit or miss on having any question you have, answered correctly or with any actual accurate detail whatsoever. whoops, my bad for expecting something a little more than a smile and a nod, possibly with with the occasional 'its spicy' tossed in to mix it up. i'm simply tired of making excuses for this place when i bring question bearing out of towners in for amazing food. and frankly, i can totally deal with the lack of fluency in english language skills, but when i am trying to speak with the waitstaff to let them know of my dissatisfaction, and they nod and smile and walk away mid sentence. well i can no longer make excuses to rationalize this situation away. in short consistency is the key to success in my opinion. why should i afford unskillfully or carelessly prepared food an excuse of 'a off day'. consistency is king. 'off days' are the mating call of the mediocre. exceptional restaurants don't have off days. i really wanted to say lao sze chuan was exceptional, but i can't.",

    "i'm a huge fan of chinatown but my family always goes to the same two places: emporer's choice and phoenix. we love them both that we never had a reason to explore other options that's why i'm grateful some work friends decided to organize a sunday evening trip to check out lao sze chuan. as a local foodie i've heard a lot about tony hu and his empire but had never experienced it myself. chinatown is great because it's both authentic yet approachable (and most restaurants have figured this out by having entirely different sections or floors for seating). lao sze chuan does a very nice job of presenting a menu with an overwhelming number of choices with clear labels to steer you on your desired path. our sunday night dinner didn't need to go exotic or push the envelope so we ordered familiar dishes and didn't even really flip the pages. everything we ordered came as expected and tasted great fully embracing the americanized chinese food we've come to love growing up on panda express :) i'm not disappointed by this because the food was high quality and gave us what we wanted. if we were interested in pigs feet or hot pots we could have ordered those (which is to say if you want adventure, there's plenty to try). we didn't send back anything left on the plates but if i had to pick a favorite dish it was the classic mongolian beef with a slightly sweeter sauce than usual as opposed to spicy. it's a tried and true dish but when you do it well, it's one of my all time favorites. i also really liked the pork mu shoo and the vegetable fried rice. the most surprising dish was our dry chili chicken, which looked a lot scarier and spicier than reality. it was simply very good fried chicken pieces in an interesting sauce. i would definitely order that again. i didn't love the pot stickers (sad day) and the string beans were nothing compared to emperor's choice beans. the lone fish dish sole in black bean sauce was solid but middle of the road comparatively. i'm a fan of lsc even if we had a little trouble with the language barrier (white rice?) and couldn't quite understand the out of focus panda pictures on the walls. our service in the beginning was also strangely absent since it was a high volume time of night. but even so, the food was very good and we had a lot of fun with a large table on a sunday night (and it's hard to ever complain about poor value in chinatown). it would be for me to choose a new place over my long time family preferences but it does go to show how many great options there are in chinatown.",

    "i brought my (chinese) mom here the last time she was in town and we were craving some spicy food. we ordered a couple of dishes off the recommended list yu xiang pork, the pea sprouts with garlic, and the house special hot and sour soup. that hot and sour soup changed my life. it is probably the best hot and sour soup i've ever had. the pork was also quite delicious usually i go for the boiled beef, but you really have to be up for the whole soaked in chili oil deal, and we were more in the mood for a medium spicy with veggies dish, and this dish definitely did it. and if you've never had pea sprouts/shoots before, you should definitely try the ones at lao sze chuan, they have a light garlicy sauce on them and are a great for breaking up the burn in your mouth.",

    "this place was perfect for when you are craving really good authentic chinese. we had their signature dry chili chicken, which was amazing. we also had the crispy shrimp with lemon sauce which was also divine. the egg rolls which are boasted about, were really nothing great, very little flavor in them. we also ordered the crispy duck, which friends recommended but to be honest it tasted like it was reheated and then crisped up. we had beef and green peppers which was a big hit as well as the green beans with spicy black bean sauce. all the dishes were great and looking around at what others were eating, makes me want to come back and try a million other things. couple of negatives which i can overlook because the food was so good. 1. the service is awful, slow, and no one speaks any english at all which makes it hard to ask questions. 2. the menus were dirty which just kind of grosses me out that i am touching it and then eating. 3. the chairs were plastic and weird and reminded me of barbie furniture and were very uncomfortable. 4. the beers were warm, almost undrinkable. that being said, it is still work coming to because the food was so unbelieveable, except for the duck, but that may have just been a fluke. i am anxious to try one of their many other places located in the same strip mall. the strip mall this is located in is also pretty cool to walk through and shop!",

    "i've been to the other lao sze chuan locations in downers grove and boston, ma, and this one is by far the worst of the three. i'm comparing across the same dishes chef's special dry chili chicken, twice cooked pork, twice cooked pork intestine, ma po to fu, and pork intestine with pork blood. the chili chicken is usually a winner but here it's dry and flavorless. there are so many chili pepper flakes that they actually interfere with the texture, but even they don't add flavor to the chicken. it's just sad and oily, even to me. the twice cooked pork here is also kind of bland and tasteless instead of rich and flavorful the way it should be. the twice cooked pork intestine dish is actually quite yummy, but the portion is quite small. the dish i enjoy the most now out of the ones i've listed is actually the pork intestine with pork blood. it kind of comes in a soup and there isn't much besides the two listed ingredients, but once you fish them out they're rich and delicious. love it. i've also tried the twice cooked duck tongue once when i was in an adventurous mood. don't get it. they're the saddest little peanut sized morsels that are mostly bone and you spend most of your time trying to figure out what is edible instead of enjoying the dish. cuisine aside, the atmosphere of the place is also mediocre. it never seems like they have enough room to accommodate people, and the hostesses are all rather rude. (watch out for the guido middle aged chinese guy with glasses who will try and manhandle you regardless of gender!) the chairs are made of transparent plastic and they're kind of haphazard about refilling tea and water. when you dine in, though, they do give you a little dish of spicy cabbage as an appetizer overall, this would not be the place to take someone you want to impress. it's where i go when i am desperate for some sort of szechuan food downtown, but not when i want genuinely good chinese food. it's not a place where i would take friends who are visiting the city, for example unless they were suffering a similar craving that could not wait until their trip out to a likely better szechuan restaurant. hint: guys, i would not pick this as a date venue unless your girlfriend loves spicy, super chinese food. p.s. if you call for delivery, the woman is strict about zoning but the man is not. aka if you live outside of their delivery zone, chances are the man will get you your food, but the woman will shut you down.",

    "been going to the lousy shoe since i was a pup. did my first work here. for the triads. not really. service c = mean surly waitresses who have been working here forever. bus boys don't bring water until you ask them 2 times. ambiance c cramped. never enough seats, even for lunch time on a freaking tuesday. food b = i used to think this place was the bees scrotum, but i have fallen out of love with chinese food. also, why is it whenever i try to order chinese food on the phone they always ask me for chinese food? example me: hello, is this lao sze chuan? can i place an order? them: chinese food? i reccomend: dim sum cashew chicken lamb curry mongolian hot pot steamed broccoli",

    "we were both hungry and when we walked up to a line out the door at 1:30p, it gave us really good vibes for this place. we were sat, well she pointed out our table, thats cool, they're busy. the table had 2 menus and shortly after we sat down, the busser brought us our setting and tea. more than 5 minutes later the server came up to us, and the first thing out of his mouth what do you want to order? luckily we had enough uninterrupted time to figure this out. 2 waters, 2 wonton soups, a crab rangoon, a ma po tofu for sara and a chili chicken for me. the entree's came first, followed by the crab rangoon, then the soup and then after that our water. the crab rangoon was full of lump crab and really good. sara's dish was really spicy and good, a lil too spicy for her. my chicken was very crispy, flavorful and had some spice. it definitely looks spicier than it is. i'd go again hoping i had a different server. go for the food, not the service!",

    "three of us came here on a saturday night when the place was packed. we had to wait 20 minutes outside the restaurant, but luckily it was a warm evening. here's what we ordered: 1) house special duck in beer sauce (in hot pot with bone) 2) boiled sole fish fillet in szechuan sauce 3) stir fried peapod leaves 4) sliced pork with dried bean curd and chives i definitely don't recommend the duck in beer sauce. if fish wasn't cooked properly and served fishy, i wonder what's the right term for duck? the duck was literally swimming in a bowl of hot oil and we had to fish them out. worse part was there weren't even that many pieces to have. i really like spicy food but oddly enough, lao szechuan's wasn't capturing. i think my favorite dish of the evening was the sliced pork with dried bean curd and chives. p.s. the wait staff was very patient with our questions even though it was a busy night. they were understaffed while tending to a party on the second floor. kudos to our waitress for recommending the sliced pork with dried bean curd/chives!",

    "oh tony, you genius bastard! how do you keep your tony's three chili chicken so crispy! it defies physics. my usual lunch order. dry chili beef to eat in and an order of tony's chicken to go. for some reason, it tastes even better cold it's pretty much the ultimate popcorn chicken. i open it up at home the next day to take one nibble, then find myself finding reasons to step back into the kitchen to grab one more piece, and this charade continues until i've eaten the whole thing. i've got several of my friends addicted to this same routine. try it some time. also, the big guy with an enormous pinkie ring that appears to be the manager is always bossing the staff in the most animated way as if he's tony soprano of chinatown it's really quite comical",

    "i am seriously considering renting a flat above just so i can live, breathe, and dream in the delicious aromas of this place 24/7. we finally made it down to lao sze chuan after years of being distracted by other goodies such as joy yee and hong kee. let's just say if i could give this place 10 stars i would. the menu, first of all, is a bible of truly authentic szechuan food. i was about to high five the waitress for not seeing a single general tsao's chicken or mongolian beef on the menu. we tried the fried green beans, spicy fried chicken, and the beef with black bean sauce. aaaaand wow. we were blown away not only by how delicious all three dishes were, but also by the unabashed, in your face spice level of each one. i had a constant grin on my face in between chugging iced water and wiping the snot off my nose. this is what real szechuan cuisine is, peeps! be forewarned though: i usually order in english at chinese restaurants to soothe the bf that i am not ordering anything potentially sketchy like fried cow penis (i would for giggles), but i had to switch over to mandarin since both the waitress and bus boy could not fathom a simple phrase such as: iced water, please. no english? chicken hearts it is. the bf also got a little miffed at the slow service, but i had to remind him that the more authentic a chinese restaurant is, the more horrible the service (and the worse the decor) is going to be. is there even a translation for good service in chinese? if there is, i don't know it. i would pick dining at lao sze chuan and their plastic table covers over the swanky lounge of a hoity toity restaurant any day. this is definitely my new favorite restaurant in chicago!",

    "excellent food, horrible service. the dmv has better service than they do. typically, when you go into a restaurant, you're asked if you want drinks and if you decline, some sort of beverage is brought out to you, typically being water. my entire lunch here went without anything to drink besides the oolong tea they serve every table, which is piping hot. i had ordered a coke only to discover they were out and so i changed the order to a sprite. i'm guessing they were out of this as 10 minutes later, two of the waiters walked in with 10 cases of an assortment of coke products. apparently, they forgot i ordered drinks. giving them a few minutes, i flagged down a waiter. asking him for a soda yielded the response, please ask your waiter for it. to which the only thing i can think of is, you are the waiter! beverage issue aside, when you come in for lunch, you should get the lunch menu, but they give you the dinner menu. you have to specifically ask for a lunch menu or else your bill will be closer to 40 instead of 20. and to get this, i had to wait another 10 15 minutes because i'm guessing the waiter did not understand which menu i was referring to or even what a a menu is. if you want to go here, great, but don't go expecting good service. best solution is to do take out from here. it'd be quick/easy without the fuss of dealing with people who cannot understand simple requests from you.",

    "i've only had one meal here but i'm pretty sure this is my new favorite chinese restaurant, not just in china town but in the entire city. i actually stumbled across lao sze chuan at the taste of chicago. unfortunately it was near the opposite end where i'd entered and after eating my way through the maze and stopping at almost every booth i just did not have any room left to try their stuff. what i saw though was fantastic! i nodded at the booth and whispered in my sexy voice that i reserve for ordering food, we shall meet again. we, in fact, did meet again and it was glorious! i got the dry chili chicken , crispy shrimp with lemon (both of which were on their taste menu) and the house special clam soup (which was chosen at random from their huge menu). all 3 things were delicious. my boyfriends favorite was the shrimp which were covered in a sweet sticky sauce. the thing that originally drew me to these shrimp is that they were not covered with breading like you usually see in dishes like these. instead they appeared to be void of breading altogether but still managed a light crisp on the outside while being perfectly cooked throughout. when i ordered it, i half expected it to be a smaller portion but we had so many shrimp that we didn't even have to fight over the last one. i would kill to have that clam soup every day. the clams were served in the shell and swimming in a perfectly spicy broth. this dish also overdid itself with the quantity of clams. my takeout order came in a large soup container and was packed so full of clams that the lid barely closed over the top. i ordered for carry out and while i was standing at the register waiting for my food i had the opportunity to check out what was on all the other tables and coming out of the kitchen. everything i saw looked fantastic. a few times i contemplated snatching a potsticker off the waitresses tray. i seriously wanted to eat all of the food i saw. if you're familiar with china town then you know it can be hard to find parking so navigating a food pick up can be tricky. the only warning i have is to beware of the red peppers because they are burn your face off hot. the dry chili chicken came with so many that we had a pile leftover after eating. who can really eat all those? really?!?! i can't wait to try everything else from the menu.",

    "i will never, never go to lao sze chuan or any lao establishment ever again, and you shouldn't either. this place used to be my go to chinese place. this was the place that i would take out of town friends to when they came in to show them the best that chicago's chinatown had to offer. unfortunately, i did just that last sunday and had the worst restaurant experience of my life. we were seated on the second level of the restaurant. first, we waited over 20 minutes as our waiter frequently walked by without stopping to welcome us, deliver water, or even acknowledge our existence. finally, he came to deliver menus and water. after waiting another 20 minutes, the waiter promptly demanded our order. both my order (spring rolls and tony's chicken) and my friend's order were straight forward. my girlfriend, however, had some questions about the menu. her queries were met with downright consternation. asked what he would recommend with chicken on the menu, the waiter quickly rattled off the szechuan chicken. when asked if it was fried, the waiter affirmed as much. my girlfriend asked if he had a recommendation that wasn't fried. the waiter simply shrugged and stared at her. and the wait began again. we waited almost an hour until our food was served. not surprisingly, the waiter forgot to ever bring my spring rolls. assuming he forgot the order because he wasn't writing anything down, i politely stayed quiet and assumed it would not be on the bill. more about that later. anyways, our food finally came. my chicken had been left in the frier for an extra 10 15 minutes. the chicken was fried until burned. none of the other dishes were up to lao sze chuan's usual standard either. we quickly finished our meals as we were starving by this time. and here comes another wait.twenty more minutes of awkward glances, staring down the waiter, and him walking right past. he would not come to our table until my girlfriend actually yelled, waiter! as he walked by. he begrudgingly stopped by our table before slowly walking back to the register where he finally calculated then delivered our check. what do you know, he charged us for the never delivered spring rolls. although our waiter had disappeared (literally walked out of the front door.), i flagged down another waiter. i explained to him that the spring rolls were never delivered. he looked at me inquisitively like he didn't believe me before offering to deliver an order of spring rolls. by this point, we had been at the restaurant for around three hours. the last thing that i wanted was an order of spring rolls. we pleaded with him to simply take the spring rolls off the check, until he finally consented. to add one final insult, as the waiter took the check back to the register, he took our fortune cookies, as well. upon delivering the amended check, he did not deliver more fortune cookies. apparently, taking a 2.50 item off your check that was never delivered means you don't get fortune cookies with your check. in the end, the service was rude, extremely slow, and inaccurate. the food was mediocre. i'm not sure what happened and what lao sze chuan has become, but it begins and ends with its terrible wait staff.",

    "hands down some of the best chinese food (if not the best) i have ever had. how good you ask? slap dont ask questions! let me share my knowledge with you, young padawan. this place specializes in spicy. right when you get your seat, they put a plate of cabbage soaked in chili oil, and fairy dusted with dried chilies. it's the perfect warm up for your meal. i ordered the chef special dry chili chicken and it was amazing. there are no less than 4 billion chili peppers in the dish and the chicken is crispy, spicy heaven. second i ordered the house special noodles, which are dry (somewhat), and coated with pepper dust. it had a ton of fresh veggies in it, and some meat. it was very delicious, and a nice component to the meal. third, came the orange beef tenderloin which was my date's favorite. it was thinly sliced beef, fried, and then tossed in a sweet orange sauce, garnished with a sliced orange. we squeezed the orange on it and it really made the dish. it was slightly americanized but hey.who gives a shit if it tastes good! and last. and the real star of the meal.was the dong po pork. bite sized hunks of pork belly (fat with streaks of meat), braised in a killer sauce for hours. they then add fried pieces of tofu, and serve. it was one of the best things i have ever tasted.ever. it was porky, fatty, and i will forever look for it. if you are in chinatown and you're ready for a great, spicy, chinese food experience, come here.",

    "just had dinner here tonight with 4 other friends. we all left very satisfied. for you spice lovers, this is the place to go. the restaurant has an extensive menu and you will be left wondering what to get. we ordered the ma po tofu, dried chili chicken, boiled beef with sauce, beef stew noodles, garlic green beans, and chengdu dumplings. everything was delicious but my favorite dish is probably the dried chili chicken. i won't go into much detail here since there are plenty of other yelpers who have commented enough about it, but if you like popcorn chicken, this is an item you must get. the spice isn't too overbearing (for me at least), but i'm used to eating spicy food. the texture of the food was great and the tofu was probably one of the more flavorful tofus i've had in a while. the only drawback is that everything comes out very oily, but that's what you get with sichuan food. place was crowded when we came in, which was a good sign. we waited about 20 minutes to get a table and were served timely. very friendly servers and host. i won't make a habit of coming to eat here because it's probably not too healthy. for example, when they brought the tofu out, you can see the layer of oil glistening and glazing on the top. also a plus if you're a student and you pay with cash.you get 10% off. afterwards, do yourself a favor and stop by joy yee for a freeze to cool you down.",

    "the heat seekers have met their first real challenge in chicago. that is right, my boyfriend and i ate the most deliciously, spicy lunch at lao sze chuan last week. we endured all sorts of sweating from every pore of our body and deep breathing that can only be compared to what mothers to be do in lamaze class. still, we managed to clear our plates and already start planning our next visit. note: we did order extra spicy, so for the weak, i am sure ordering at normal levels is tolerable. this is the second time eating at lao sze chuan. first time, we enjoyed it, but we were kind of overwhelmed with the intimidating menu and ordered hastily, not reading recommendations before. earlier this month, i was reminded of the amazingness of lao sze chuan at taste of chicago when i had the chef's special dry chili chicken. that is when i became obsessed. seriously, obsessed. meaning, i thought about it at least twenty times a day and bugged my boyfriend until he finally got sick of the constant harassment and agreed to go with me. we ventured out to chinatown where we had what i call the meal to end all meals. of course, we ordered the chef's special dry chili chicken and it was spectacular. we also ordered the boiled beef in spicy szechuan sauce. i hate to admit it, but the boiled beef stole the show, which is obviously a hard feat. i read a couple reviews before hand that raved about the boiled beef, and they also warned readers not to be intimidated by the idea of it being boiled. i am so glad i listened and we gave it a try. this was hands down, the most flavorful, tender, divine beef i have ever tasted. not to mention, it was sooooo spicy. you could see the spices in the broth and the many different peppers used to give it such a scrumptious, full bodied flavor. i get very excited just thinking about how flavorful the broth was. with every bite you could taste the delectable spices that perfectly marinated the beef. each bite was like fireworks of flavor and heat going off in your mouth. i was going to ask for the remaining broth to go, but instead we decided to be gluttons and order more rice so we could eat it on the spot. it was that good that we couldn't even wait to eat it, we had to eat it all right there. in sum, the combination of the chef's special dry chili chicken and the boiled beef in spicy szechuan sauce made this the meal to end all meals. the heat seekers left lao sze chaun happy, satisfied, and sweaty. i don't even care what the service is like. the food overshadowed every flaw this place may have. i am contemplating moving to chinatown just so i can get this place regularly. it is amazing! i never thought i would claim a chinese restaurant as one of my favorite restaurants i have ever been to, but i cannot deny that lao sze chuan has stolen my heart. there will never be better chinese food. never! never!",

    "on our last day in town, my boyfriend and i red lined it down to chinatown because, well, we wanted some chinese food, and isn't that where you go? we wanted something spicy, and you yelpers said this was the money szechuan in the area, so this is where we went. i was so overwhelmed by the menu. so many choices, so little time! i went with something that's hard to find in utah chinese restaurants: stir fried kidney. my boyfriend got some supposedly extra spicy special crispy noodle dish with pork and squid. we started with the sizzling rice soup. the soup was slightly underwhelming, mostly because i was expecting a chicken broth based soup (which is how i've usually had sizzling rice soup). this was more sweet and sour based, and while good, i love that other version, so i had my hopes up. the kidneys cured me, though. they were meaty and delicious, though the sauce wasn't that spicy. i should have gone with the kung pao version. the super spicy noodles had a bite to them, but it seemed like they definitely gringoed up the spices for us. we can handle it, i swear! but the flavors were nice, and i really liked the dish. they served chili cabbage before the other dishes came that we seemed to eat in record time. very nice flavor. service was pretty standard for a chinese restaurant, which means they were polite and efficient, and you can't go wrong with that. the price was very nice as well. overall, a very good experience.",

    "are you in the mood for some steaming hot bowl of make it yourself all you can eat boiling deliciousness? if so, look no further, the hot pot was mm mm good. (~16pp +tip and tax) i'm reserving a star because 1) haven't tried anything else from them 2) service was as others have said, a little pushy. i'm abc too, so the waitresses and owner, i think, spoke english to us, and basically assumed that we were there for the hot pot, and instead of asking what we wanted, she just said 3 orders hot pot, right? 3) the lamb was really gamey, not a fan. but the goods: 1) all you can eat hotpot comes with seafood (jellyfish, squid, fish, fish balls, mussels), meat (beef, lamb), tofu, veggies (cabbage, lettuce, green onions, watercress). everything was so fresh. (didn't like the lamb tho) 2)the broth was delicious from the get go and that's what really makes or breaks hot pot. 3) the service to refill our plates was impeccable they asked us if we wanted more even before we waved anyone down! they even came around with a pot of hot water when the broth was getting low. they could use some better dipping sauces (they had a weak xo like sauce spicy seafood, sesame paste, and garlic). i would totally come back though. and we came around 8:30pm on a thursday night and it was seriously packed to the walls, we got the last table, and about half of the people had hotpot. get it. you know you want some steaming vat of goodness.",

(gotta love those told you so moments) i was a fan of the fish. the beef itself that did eventually get ordered was 95% fat. the broth used for the hot pot was delicious. i would give this place 5 stars for hot pot but minus one for the lack of service until i busted out my broken mandarin.",

    "i've been meaning to write this review for over six months, which is funny because if i was as prompt as i really should have been, my rating would have been higher. i first ate at lao szechuan about 5 years back. since then i live walking distance from there and have been there or ordered out from there way too many times than i care to count. food has been excellent and spicy just the way i have come to expect. ive had many different dishes there, some very strange sounding but all of them taste good. the dry chilli chicken and szechuan dry chili string bean kind of stand out, as does their spicy lamb dish. but the last three times i have been there (last two months), while the food definitely still retains the flavor, the service has started to get very tardy and rude. late service, grumpy faces, throwing your check on your table without even looking at you, are all experiences i have had in the last three times. c'mon guys, is my 70 buck check amount not even deserving of a smile while you present it to me? do i have to beg you 3 times over a period of 20 minutes to get my flipping check? given that and the long average waiting period standing outside, i have to take away two stars. when service was good and friendly, i was willing to overlook this but now i may probably go back to eating once in a rare while here and even then probably take out.",

    "whenever i see a clean chinese restaurant with modern decor, my first thought is to be wary, since typically the best ones are hole in the walls that only have asian people eatin in here. lao sze chuan had nice waiter service (seriously? a nice waiter in a chinese restaurant?) and was clean and modern. but most important, their food was really good! we first ordered the mapo tofu. the waiter was accomodating when i requested mildly spicy, he asked on a scale of 1 to 10, how spicy. i thought that was a thoughtful and helpful question, as no one wants food that turns out spicier or blander than expected. also loved their chicken lo mein that really suprised me how much i liked this dish, considering it's really more of an americanized dish but man they make it really well here! tender steaming meat in a tasty perfectly seasoned sauce and i think the noodles are homemade as it had a great texture. i mean, i really do think it's hard to make a standout lo mein dish, of all dishes. but this one was one i'd go back just to have! also liked how fresh and perfectly seasoned /stirfried was their garlic chinese broccoli. almost refreshing in a sense that the veggies just tasted fresh and crisp. their beef noodle soup is their signature but for americans, watch out how spicy this can be. it's quite intense and a red colored brot, and not what i was expecting. very flavorful, a little too salty for me. i think i prefer taiwanese style beef noodle soup over this. lastly, unlike most chinese resaturants that service dry cheap rice, their rice was pretty decent and the better quality stuff. that totally is rare. in summary, their chinese food was pretty good for the chicagoland area.",

    "went here today for lunch with my boyfriend. we ordered the sesame chicken, sweet and sour pork ribs and the garlic eggplant. about 15 minutes after we ordered i was told they were out of eggplant. i was a little annoyed by this development because, 1) garlic eggplant is one of my favorite dishes and 2) it was only 1pm. to replace the eggplant i got an order of spring rolls. the spring rolls were mediocre, i have definitely had better. the pork ribs were good, but nothing special. the sesame chicken was a definite let down everything about the meal seemed half baked. i don't know if my experience was a one off event, but i will not be returning to confirm my initial judgment.",

    "huge! pretty much the word to describe lao sze chuan, except for the actual size of the restaurant. it's pretty cramped and tight inside. their menu huge! i was impressed with the many seafood selections especially for this catholic girl coming here on a lenten friday night with a bunch of friends. our table was huge! we thankfully had a reservation so we had the big table against the wall by the door. i seriously recommend making a reservation, there was a crazy wait to eat here, i never even knew this gem was in china town. they have one in downer's grove, which i have to try since it's closer to my house! so the hot pot, or in other words, chinese fondue looked incredible. the people in my group who ate this, kept eating it and couldn't stop. it helps that the food is unlimited. i ordered the sole (fish) with lobster sauce. it was pretty tasty. the food here isn't out of this world. i think it's more the experience and great conversation that people have over eating the hot pot. i will definitely try it when i can eat meat though! yum, i can't wait :)",

    "loved my experience here, and i'm definitely coming back when in chinatown. ever since my time carousing ghost street in beijing (known for its vast array of restaurants from the sichuan, hunan, etc provinces), i've had a serious hot pot addiction. i finally got a chance to relieve that craving when a large group of my friends went on a thursday night a little after chinese new year. my boyfriend and i ordered the deluxe hot pot while the rest of my friends ordered various dishes. i must say the hot pot hit the spot! the portions of proteins and veggies to cook in it were very generous, and the sauces were great. the only thing i would have wished for was if the chili broth was spicier. i love that tingly, cool effect that sichuan peppercorns yield when in hot pots, but i wasn't getting it. so i'm thinking it's either 1) there were just normal peppercorns in my hot pot, 2) the guy kept diluting our concentrated broth with more water, so the heat wasn't as intense.maybe because i was sharing with the white boyfriend, or 3) the friend next to me voiced some serious concern over how spicy her order would be and perhaps the staff extrapolated her concern with the rest of our group. either way, it wasn't the end of the world because everything was still pretty tasty. despite my large portions, i had to taste all of my friends' food as well. the lamb with cumin was amazing! on top of the quality food we were feasting on, a man who must have been the manager (i'm guessing.) was wielding around this golden weapon prop from the chinese new years parade for some guests. we were amused and took notice, so he approached us explaining he has so many leftover things from the parade he hasn't brought home yet pointing out the large chinese drum near the doorway. we must have looked fairly curious about it because he then greeted the whole restaurant a happy new year and started playing on the drum for an astonishing performance. our table was so entertained, and it didn't stop there! he wanted to show us the parade lion as well, so he had staff from i'm assuming lao beijing come over with it. he then put it over his body to dance like how it's done in the parade! it was pretty awesome. guess i don't feel so bad i missed the festivities over the new year weekend, lao sze schuan made our diverse group feel like we were part of the celebration anyways!",

    "lao sze chuan is awesome. tommy the doorman is hilarious. he recognized my family from back in the day where we used to eat at triple crown seafood in oakbrook., where he also worked as a doorman there either way, he gave us great tips on what to get and we followed. this is one of those places where the page says house specialty and it actually means house specialty. we got chilled spicy beef tendon for our appetizer, garlic on choy (we have to have vegetables, even if it is slathered in oil), steamed fish with ginger, hot pot, and the special chili chicken. oh the spices were just right on the beef tendon, hot pot broth and the szechuan chicken. it had the numbing spice perfectly done. it was just the right. for those of you not used to numbing spice. its a great feeling of a small electric current that's just addictive. the chillis are native to szechuan, china. it really adds an umph to any other spices and flavors on it. its a little more hard to find than other typical chinese places, but lao sze chuan offers it and specializes in it. however, i think my dad was a little ambitious when he ordered hot pot on top of what normal families would consider gluttonous amounts of food. the hot pot was awesome. we got everything from beef to intestines and kidneys. all of which were tender. this place even did a fancy cut/score on the kidneys so it even stayed tender after cooking. its the little details that count. we killed the hot pot and only ate. a third of the other dishes. the staff was extremely friend and readily boxed our food and extra rice. i'll be enjoying my left overs for days.",

(just avoid the coriander!) note that since this is a szechuan place, expect a lot of spiciness. also, have to give some props to the service, something chinatown's notoriously bad about. even with a packed house, it's pretty easy to flag someone down if you need something. sure, it's something that you'd expect from any other restaurant, but it's a stand out attribute on archer.",

    "360 reviewers can't be wrong, can they? well.actually.they can, but in this case, i think they've got it just right. since i'm just coming off the flu, i'll admit i'm a little too lazy and tired to read many previous reviews. but i managed enough strength to see the handful of negative reviews focused on service at lao. so let me take a stab at it. folks.this is chinatown. this is a culture that might be different to you. welcome to the melting pot that is our happy little country. i claim to have no inside knowledge of the chinese culture, but i think it's not hard to determine that the service vibe is just a little different sometimes in chinatown. in some ways, i think the lack of the kissing your aarse smiling hostess even though she is slammed is a bit refreshing! you're a little busy to put on the smile and you probably seriously don't give a damn about that. i feel ya.no sweat.just keep workin' the tables to get me and my lovely wife a seat, thanks! look.you get some thankyous and general politeness too. they aren't the gestapo or anything. these guys are focused and efficient.just without the niceties you get in other restaurants. different than what you are used to is not automatically bad. and if you can't give props to that unusually energetic guy at the door, you are simply missing out. yeah.he's kind of like your slightly sauced(booze or upper?), overly loud, and sometime overly sarcastic uncle. he could be a freaking character in a movie.that's how much flavor this guy has. so enough of my liberal rantings. love your brother, peace.etc.move on to the grub, bud. and the food is where these guys shine. i can't say i've had many dishes here, yet i've been here numerous times. that's simply because it's hard to try new things when you like the first things you tried so much. did i just skip the gateway drug and go straight to the crack? maybe my friends.and i think it's time for you to upgrade yourself, if you haven't tried it. wink.wink.creepy overly mature dude in school trying to get you to try something you are not sure you should try. my wife loves the broiled beef in the spicy szechuan sauce, craving it every couple weeks. on our last visit, we had this app that i absolutely love! thin slices of beef in that delicious spicy chili sauce(same sauce as the pickled cabbage slices).little bit of fat mixed in there and some sinewy bits too.awesome app, i'm telling you. i couldn't begin to pronounce it, but damn it tastes good. now.i also like the governors chicken.that's probably like a totally white person dish(not sure?), but it's a great sweet compliment to the spicy dishes you are likely to encounter here. real chicken chunks in this great batter that hold a nice level of crunch even while drowned in a sweet saucy glaze. lsc is almost always bustling, and you might have to wait a smidge, but it's well worth it! thx lsc.you deal good product and you know ill be back for another dime bag soon.",

    "so to start, i am a server in a standard american chain so i know how to serve but i am aware of cultural differences that exist, and even more acutely conscious of the 'asian stigma,' seeing as i am a half asian living a few blocks from chinatown. okay, overtly long intro run on sentence. first, i must say i came in an hour before close to order some fried rice. yeah, i know, super lame but i had a hankering. upon entering, the male owner instructed me to head on back to make a carryout order. first of all i noticed the waitress was chilling out and eating in the dining room and was definitely unhappy about having me inconvenience her dining experience. plus, before i ordered she told me i was being unclear when i told her i wanted to get food to go, which i didn't understand.but i tend not to argue with people who have contact with my food. she got confused about my desire for soup that wasn't egg drop or hot and spicy. she kept on asking me if i wanted a hot pot, which i saw on a table nearby and looked delicious but i couldn't get one to go, so no, i just wanted a different soup. either way it was frustrating that she kept on asking for something if i wanted something that i couldn't even order. then after placing my order and awkwardly standing near the back, the owner came up and put a sprite in my hand and led me to a chair and physically sat me down. now this may seem to some to be man handling, but he had a kind face and he genuinely wanted me to be comfortable. i then watched as he and his staff enjoyed dinner. but that being said, the fried rice was actually phenomenal. probably phenomenally bad for me, but tasted wonderful. i ate half of it, and i was full past that comfortable stage. their hot pot looks amazing and one day when it's super cold, i plan on heading that way and enjoying some. so, it's got really great fried rice, and amazing looking hot pot.so probably does other asian inspired dishes well. just be aware of the less than accommodating service.",

    "extremely disappointing! maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe i just don't actually like real chinese food. either way, it was not worth the trek. on their menu, we did not see egg rolls listed, only spring rolls, even though steve dahl is quoted on their menu as saying they have the best egg rolls. so we asked our waiter if they did serve egg rolls, he said yes, so we ordered 2. what came out were definitely spring rolls, and not very good ones at that. too much over fried crispyness on the outside or something. we also ordered the crab rangoon, which also were too fried and not very flavorful. maybe i'm just used to the kind of rangoons that are mostly cream cheese with little crab, but i think these had heavy crab and little cream cheese, which in my book were not very good. i read the rave reviews here on yelp of the ma po tofu, and since it was listed as one of their spicy specialties, i ordered it. this was probably one of the most disgusting dishes that i have ever been served in my life. ok, that may be a bit of an overstatement, but it was inedible. i'm not sure if they used silken tofu or what, but it was like eating mushy baby food but with an even more weird texture. the flavor of the spicy sauce was decent, but since the majority of the dish was mushy tofu, it was inedible. even my boyfriend who eats anything didn't like it. my boyfriend's dish wasn't nearly as terrible as mine, it was also from the spicy specialty menu, some kind of spicy chicken chili dish, which he said was quite good but way too many hard, inedible peppers in the dish. it was quite spicy by his account, he was definitely sweating and his face was flushed while eating (which is a good thing). my mom ordered the kung pao chicken, which was the highlight of the meal, the flavor was what one would expect from top notch kung pao. this dish was at the level we thought all the dishes would be.alas, we were not that fortunate. will not return, would much rather try the hundreds of other chinese restaurants nearby than return. or i should probably just stick to thai food.more veggies, less oil and better spicy flavors.",

    "ummmm, ok. like, the food is good, but i don't understand how it's zagat rated nor why there's a line out the door on any given night. the food seems comparable to any other restaurant in chinatown. the orange beef and chili chicken were my highlights of the meal, but nothing to sit here and rave about. the seafood platter, tripe stew, stir fry eggplant and peapod leaves were fine, too, but, again, nothing to dream about. however, this restaurant is distinctively clean.and that's probably one of the reasons why it's put on some type of pedestal. maybe? it's also pretty pricey for the amount of food you're getting. expect 10+ for an entree no joke. for chinatown, those prices are just ridic. oh, and the service is bad. i don't know if we went on a bad night, but whoever wrote that the service was friendly and quick were clearly smoking something. we asked for water 2x before they actually brought it out. (i don't think we ever got a refill, btw.) i also asked for more rice 2x before someone completely different brought it out. the only time they were attentive was when they wanted us to free up our table, so they practically threw down the bill at the same time they started clearing away our plates. summary: +overpriced +small portions +bad service +potentially overrated",

    "a few of us went here for hot pot one night. unfortunately none of us had had much experience with it so it actually ended up being a little frustrating trying to order how we (thought) we wanted it. the waiter kept suggesting that we get the deluxe hot pot which would have been about 22 per person with tax and tip which i would not have minded but some people didn't really want to spend that much. so we went with two pots one spicy and one not spicy. the waiter insisted that only one pot would be okay and that we could have a spicy and non spicy side since the pot has a divider but a few thought that would not be enough.anyway in the end that's what we should have done. i was extremely hungry and it took forever for them to get our pots out and going. we should have ordered appetizers but i didn't know that it would take that long.i wasn't extremely happy nor satisfied with the experience, partly our fault and partly theirs. i think next time i go we will just order dishes and go family style.",

    "there's the conventional wisdom that after eating chinese food, you'll be hungry again in 20 minutes. yea, if you order from the crappy place in your local strip mall. i don't think i can go back to those days. is lao sze chuan the best chinese restaurant in chicago? possibly. is it the best i've ever had? absolutely. a short walk from the cermak chinatown red line stop gets your senses going as with all the restaurants along archer, the entire neighborhood smells like chinese food. unlike the super fried half asseries common in most chinese places, here, the chinese food actually tastes like.you know.food! but spiceophobes beware. the name of the restaurant has sze chuan in it. you are in for some fire. for an appetizer, i had the sze chuan dry beef, which another member of our table aptly described as chinese jerky. perhaps accurate, but i kinda wish i had a bag of it that i could eat at my desk at work. delicious. i can't accurately describe each of the entrees, because i grabbed them all and made it into a giant sze chuan mound on top of rice. the self made melange consisted of sole fish cutlet in chili bean sauce, salt and pepper prawns, tony's chicken with three chili (the clear winner at our table), that by the end left even this spiceophile reaching for his tsing tao to put out the flames. baby baicai with mushrooms and a crispy sweet potato dessert helped mellow out the end of the meal. the only complaint that i have is they screwed up our tabs, putting some drinks on other people's tabs, and giving our table fewer checks than we had people, then accusing our group that some people had not paid. well yea, because you put the drink on another check. in other circumstances, that could have been a lot more annoying. i would highly recommend lao sze chuan for a date, or a group of friends, especially if you want to take your date or friends out of the sheltered purview of the north side, but make sure you call ahead! by 7:30 the place was packed and they were turning away people at the door.on a tuesday! safe to say lao sze chuan is the first chinese restaurant in chicago that left me feeling.full!",

    "i really used to like lao sze chuan because they make their food spicy. but my last dining experience was awful which says something since i'm pretty tolerant of bad service from asian restaurants. i ordered mapo tofu and asked if it came with meat. they told me 'no' so i asked for them to put some pork in there. when i got my dish there was a thick red layer of oil on top and about a teaspoon of ground pork in the middle. it was disgustingly salty, too. needless to say, i couldn't finish it. they asked if we wanted rice. we thought that was strange but shrugged it off. tip if an asian restaurant asks if you want rice, ask if they charge for them. we both got charged each for our bowl of rice. they told us it was endless refill but only after we asked why we were charged. i'm sorry but chinese restaurant charging for bowls of rice is just appalling. i wish they would have told us about charging, too, because we didn't even eat it. anyways, the service is always horrible and this experience did it for me. no more.",

    "wow, this was my first ever time to chinatown, and i am so happy that we chose lao sze chaun. the doorman was really nice and eager to seat us.and the smell of all the food just emanated and filled the room, which made my mouth start to water and tummy start to growl. we couldn't get to our table fast enough. our server was nice, exact and straight to the point. we sat there for a lil bit, which we weren't complaining at all about because of the extensive menu.wow! they have everything! and when i mean everything, it. is. everything. i was unsure on what to order except for one thing. first things first. tsing tsao. yes, please. i would order 2 at a time if i was allowed. the beer is fantastic, and super easy to drink. the restaurant is lit up very brightly, even at 10 o'clock at night. perhaps so you can see your food, maybe so you don't sit around and linger, i dunno, but at first it kind of weirded me out, but i think i might have liked it. i wasn't getting sleepy from stuffing my face, and it allowed me to see what others were eating, to help me figure out what the heck i was about to put in my belly. i decided on the beef and peapods. i know, i know, seems kind of boring, but it was amazing. not like your typical take out beef and peapods, but a million times better. very flavorful. and yes, it tasted like beef. we also ordered the chicken and red chiles. not at all what we imagined, but delish all the same. it was more like fried chicken with about 75 red peppers with it, but it doesn't have a sauce or anything. we followed other yelp reviews and ordered, and yes, it was pretty good, however, i think we could have found something a little bit better. the spicy coleslaw they serve at the beginning of the meal is a great starter. nice work. the spring roll was your typical spring roll, however, minus the plate full of grease. being a chinatown virgin, and picking this place out, i feel like we sealed the deal, and we'll be back. thank you (xiexie)",

    "i only order the fried rice and string beans because all of the other stuff on the menu is a hit or miss, and i'm tired of striking out. i had really bad service once wherein i ordered garlic chicken with bone, as it stated on the menu. it came chopped up like nuggets and boneless. i complained to manager and they said it was a typo. well that's great! i ordered something i didn't want and it didn't even taste good. that was definitely a miss. the service was also terrible. they were somewhat busy, but took 15 mins to get my check, sent me wrong order, brought out my friend's meal 10 minutes before my meal, and the servers barely speak english there! if you go there do try the fried rice it's the best in chinatown.",

    "decent chinese. 5 stars for spiciness. i'll prob go back but there are better places in chinatown. ordered the potstickers, boiled beef in spicy szechuan sauce, chef's special dry chilli chicken, and the ma po tofu. they were all good choices but the boiled beef stood out as best to me. the almost broth like sauce comes blanketed in chili pepper flakes (see my pic), great over sticky white rice, the cabbage gives it a nice crunch, the beef is soft and tender, but the spicy flavor punch hits you hard in just the right spot. our chicken was ok. it had potential but it came out kind of dry like it was over fried. yes, it's breaded and fried chicken pieces. we were not expecting that but it was eaten up despite it's arid texture. potstickers are a classic. great doughy outside. always my chinese comfort food. the tofu was the runner up. great flavors. i forgot to mention they serve a spicy cabbage and onion slaw app that comes with your food. i dig it. unfortunately it took quite some time to get our food. we went tonight on a friday at 7:30. it was def busy but i know they could have done way better service wise. at least the server was nice and they didn't mind splitting our check 4 ways on credit cards. my take: the spot is a chinatown staple. if you haven't been you should try it especially if you love spicy. not recommended for those afraid of spice. they would be in some kind of hell i'm sure. if traveling with those people i would bypass this place and head to joy yee where the white people go.",

    "so my friends and i went to china town to eat something yummy and aloysius tak (also a fellow yelper) suggested lao sze chuan. we went around 8:45pm and it was still quite busy but we were seated right away. our table of 5 did family style (share all of our dishes) and got the mapo tofu, dry chili chicken, boiled beef in szechuan sauce, and salt and pepper shrimp. there was a side dish of the spicy cabbage in chili that was spicy and addicting. i couldn't stop eating the cabbage! the mapo tofu and dried chili chicken came out first with a huge bowl of white rice and omygosh the mapo tofu was so warm and of course spicy but the tofu was cooked just right, not too mushy. the chili chicken was delicious also but i thought there was not enough chicken and too much chili on the dish. the boiled beef in szechuan sauce was ok, super hot (temperature wise) and burned my tongue and i wasn't wowed by this dish. also a very spicy dish. the salt and pepper shrimp was very tasty! it was like shrimp tempura but even better. i was surprised the dish wasn't bigger and didn't have alot of shrimp (everyone had about 2 3 shrimps) and the shrimp sizes weren't big at all either. the service here is terrible. we had to ask several times for our water to be refilled and the waitress does not speak english well at all. i understand this is china town but there is alot of american customers and you should atleast have some sort of understanding of english. anyways, i loved the food here and i would definitely come back again.",

    "spicy lovers will be in for quite a delight, while some others are in for a fright (more on this in a bit)! first off, much like a vegetarian shouldn't be surprised if they walk into a steakhouse and find the overwhelming amount of spicy menu items, you shouldn't be surprised to find spicy menu items at a place that specializes in szechuan style cooking. fortunately: 1) any spicy dish can be altered into a non spicy, mild, medium or extra spicy dish. 2) szechuan style cooking also implies unique dishes, of which they have a good variety of. the menu itself tries to keep recognizable choices in earlier in the menu, keeping the more exotic, authentic or adventuresome choices for later in the menu. they serve a small appetizer of spicy cabbage that you should probably refrain from trying if you frequently complain that mild spicy things are too much for you. they had a very tasty chef's special dry chili chicken, which comes with a good abundance of dry chili, which gives a decent amount of pop, without taking away any flavor. the mongolian beef is not made to be a spicy dish. instead is a combination of beef, onions and mushrooms with a light brown sweet sauce. the beef comes out nice and tender and works well with the sauce. and for those that prefer things less meaty, the tong cai is a chinese broccoli or spinach that is stir fried in a light sauce or oil. i recommend getting it with the garlic, which is thinly sliced, fried and served with the dish. so what's so frightful, you may ask? well, we were in on a monday night around 10 pm, knowing that they close at 12 am. being fans of white rice, we ordered a portion to go along with our meal. after finishing the first portion, we tried asking for a second portion. guess what we found out? sorry, we're out of white rice. what? what?!?!? such a frightful world to live in, i tell you. a chinese restaurant that's out of cooked white rice? i'm sure it was an aberration, and it will never happen again, but if it happens to you, let me know. it may be the first sign of the apocalypse! anyway, lots of tasty options to come back for, a tasty delight!",

    "i loved this place. every dish we ordered was spicy. many dishes push the boundaries of what westerners are comfortable with, but there are some options for picky eaters too. the flavors are bold and diverse, and although most dishes are spicy, they're all flavored in very different ways. good for vegetarians. reasonably priced. service was slow, but the waiter was very courteous, and the slow service was understandable given that the place was absolutely packed when we were there. i definitely plan to come back here, although in general, my experiences in chicago's chinatown have all been top notch. a lot like cleveland's chinatown, and in stark contrast, say, to philadelphia's and new york's, which are hit or miss. chalk it up to the hidden secret that the midwest is actually the cultural capital of ethnic cuisine in america.",

    "ok, so i'm a bit more of a flexitarian than a vegetarian when it comes to what i consider culinary anthropology so when my friend suggested hot pot i relented because i had no idea what that was. what it is is delicious, at least at lao szu chuan. we ordered the split pot which came with a large soup pot with a metal divider separating the chicken based spicy broth from the non spicy broth. with the lunch special we got a set list of goodies to boil in that broth at leisure fish balls, some kind of seafood ball, baby bok choy, water cress, raw fish and other raw meats, cabbage, noodles and a few other unknowns in the vegetable area. i recommend asking for the glass noodles rather than the vermicelli the special comes with. the vermicelli tend to get too soggy, sticky and chewy. the problem with the glass noodles is the logistics of getting it back out of the pot without making a mess, but it's worth it. the dish also comes with three sauces to add. one is a sweeter oil base with garlic, another soy ginger, and my favorite peanut. although you can do the individual order hot pot in which you choose individually priced items to boil (all veggies including black mushrooms) the dish would still not be appropriate for the true vegetarian due to the chicken base broth. unfortunately that can't be altered, i asked.",

    "i heard there was a fire here back at the end of march 2010; their kitchen was destroyed. but tony hu, owner of the chain of lao eateries had his flagship restaurant back in business by the first of may. so having never been here before, i guess we are part of their post incendium (after the fire) customers. the decor is all still spanking new (no doubt to get rid of any smoke smell), and here is where my first complaints arise. the clear acrylic chairs! others below have commented on these too. they are cheesy looking and rickety, even though they are one piece molded. the smaller than standard seat of these chairs was ok for our group, but i fear bigger (i'm sorry, but american sized) butts are not going to be comfortable with them. most of our group loved the food here, even though we usually go for cantonese cuisine. we had two appetizers, the jelly fish shanghai style and the ginger calamari (the all around favorite). we had six main dishes that we shared, and we liked them all, but the stand outs were the stir fried sole fish fillet with straw mushrooms (the largest any of us had eaten) in oyster sauce and the still memorable mongolian lamb. there are plenty more dishes on their extensive menu that we'll want to try on another visit here. the table nearest to the entrance or to the kitchen are usually the ones we avoid or reject. but on this visit, there wasn't another option, so we took the table at the entrance. we had to ask that the door be closed so the sparse amount of air conditioned coolness wouldn't escape. this was also the gathering spot for the clamor of diners who showed up without a reservation and where the lao chain's traffic cop would direct them either to the overflow room upstairs or to the close by other two lao restaurants (lao shanghai + lao beijing). our table was large enough (set for 8 places) that it had what looked like the traditional lazy susan you'll find at many chinese restaurants. but after many failed attempts to use it as such, to rotate food to fellow diners, we discovered (with one accidental spill) that it was an immobile model and useless.",

    "came out here for dinner tonight with a good friend of mine, and i absolutely dig it. first off, let's take a look at the the menu shall we? it's huge. there's a ton of stuff, and a lot of stuff out here that will be really impressive to order in front of your whiter than thou friends. we started with a couple of sapporos and some szechuan rabbit. now, keep in mind, there's an actual warning on the menu that the rabbit has bones in it, so i don't wanna hear anyone bitching about bones. rabbit has bones. if you're not willing to commit to nibbling and gnawing through tiny rabbit bones then you don't deserve the tender marinated goodness of the meat. man up. on to the next. my friend ordered the triple spice lamb, which was so good that it baaaaaah ed while you ate it. i ordered the spicy pork intestine (cause i'm that guy!) and it was incredible. problem is, i was halfway through the dish when i discovered the delicious bed of cabbage beneath the offallic goodness. the crunch of the cabbage is the perfect compliment to the soft buttery goodness of the meat. and good lord, i want to be embalmed with their spicy sauce. i can't wait to come back here and try something new. i'll be hard pressed to try anywhere new until i try at least five new dishes here!",

    "if your looking for great spicy chinese food this is the place. a group of us went before our union meeting. we go once a month and pick a different restaurant in chinatown to visit. this month was lao sze chuan which was put on hold last month due to the fire. new decor is modern but the plastic patio furniture chairs felt like they would break under us. started out with the house special hot and sour soup and if you are a chili head than this is for you, the hottest i have ever had. the spring rolls and pot stickers are good but not much different than other restaurants. we had dry chili chicken (great), mongolian lamb (tasted like the beef), kung pao shrimp (good), house fried noodles ( not as spicy as we thought), dragon and phoenix ( ok). most of the customers were having the hot pots so next time we will try that. overall a great experience.",

    "time to reload my favorite chinese spot. after a quick bout with chinese lightning, lao is open again! a nice remodel that features some tasteful updating, although i found the chairs terribly uncomfortable, but that may be by design. tony doesn't want you sitting on your bloated ass while diners are waiting to spend their money. the bathrooms are the biggest improvement, although clean and new, maybe not the most efficient, but a nice surprise. food was fresh and spot on as always, the potstickers were good, as was a beef and snow pea, very rich and the pods were among the freshest and most perfectly cooked i have had. i worked in the garden extensively over the past week and was really in the mood for veggies. i ordered the szechuan vegetables, a simple preparation of stir fried veggies and some chicken stock (i think). while on many occasions this dish may have left me wanting something that had organs, it was perfect, a nice melange of very fresh vegetables perfectly cooked, the snow peas and bamboo shoots really stood out. this would be a nice dish to add to a large family style dinner to round out many of the heavy traditional szechuan dishes. in the past my favorites have been the pork belly with tofu, a long braised rich decadent dish. fried salt and pepper lamb, (my sons favorite food on earth) crispy and tender it defies logic, three chili chicken with bone, remember those old reese's peanut butter cup commercials where the chocolate and peanut butter crash into each other? well sometimes the whole is greater than the parts, a southbound chicken slams into a north bound bag o hot peppers, garlic and ginger, there is a fire and from this tragedy comes a bowl of fiery goodness. another great are the bok choy and black mushrooms, there are many variations, but this is simple and relies on the ingredients freshness, the green is super green, the black is like that brand new heavy metal shirt you bought back in '83, each item shines on it's own and the whole creation is zenlike. don't be shy ordering here, always get one dish more than you need, just to taste. freshness is key here and if you are paying attention you will see what is wrong with many other chinese restaurants.",

    "lao sze chuan makes me very very happy. i haven't tried the hot pots, but i can say that the mapo dofu and home style bean curd are fantastic, and their pork and chicken are actually edible. (i have found numerous chinese restaurants in chicago that serve something stringy and tough and call it chicken.) i love that you can get dishes extra spicy, i love the appearance of less than americanized items, like blood and tofu stew, and i love the spicy cabbage appetizer that comes with every meal. negatives? i think the menu is too large. if they picked their best dishes and focused on those, they would be absolutely stellar. also, when you get things to go, they are begrudging to give you extra rice. you really have to beg them for it, which is very annoying.",

    "for someone who moved to chicago from nyc 8 years ago and has complained about the awful chinese food here for that entire duration, i guess i should be held somewhat accountable for never checking out any of the restaurants in chinatown. this past weekend, two friends and i headed to lao sze chaun (only one in the group had been prior and raved about it) myself and the other person (both nyers) were very excited to try what might finally be great chinese food. the drive from the west loop was really quick and although they don't deliver, its definitely close enough to me for a last minute chinese food craving. anyway, we pulled up to the packed, but very unassuming restaurant and were told the wait would be about 20 minutes. the place was split in terms of clientele the chinese contingent definitely boded well for a great meal. when we finally sat, we are all starving and the menu is enormous. many of the things on the menu are very traditional and not really my cup of tea however, after navigating the menu, i'd say at least 3/4 of it are very accessible for just about anyone who enjoys chinese food. we settled on the following: egg drop soup some of the best i've ever had green beans in spicy black bean sauce (appetizer) perfect spice/kick and we housed the dish in like two minutes pork potstickers different than any i've had. cooked perfectly (seemed to be seared then deep fried) and the flavor was phenomenal spring rolls which i didn't sample (there were only two) tony's chicken with hot peppers (don't recall the exact name) but it was great quality white meat chicken battered and deep fried with spicy peppers amazing szechaun beef tenderloin nice cut of beef, great array of fresh veggies, and a fantastic slightly spicy sauce garlic chicken only had a taste of this, but as the most americanized dish we had it was head and shoulders better than any similar dish i've had at any chinese place in the city. service was efficient, nothing to write home about but that's the last thing we were worried about. there's tons of places to eat in the one strip where lao's is located but i think my next trip to chinatown will be right back to where the experience started! finally!",

    "last winter, the guy i was seeing would always want to go here on sunday afternoons. i didn't really like chinese food, but i liked him, so i'd put up with it. in time, the place grew on me the food was regularly good, the staff were regularly friendly and we were never rushed to end our lazy sunday meal. instead, they patiently waited for us to stop drawing pictures of each other's mothers on the paper covering the table cloths. when the plates get too messy, they bring a new one.and sometimes the tall woman waitress sings. eric likes dungeoness lobster, i like dry chili beef, and cumin lamb. we both like the cabbage that comes out as an aperitif. it's been a little over a year since i first tried lsc, and sometimes, i get sentimental for it. looking back, we've had some important times in that place. maybe if he and i make it another year, we will have a party in the upstairs room where all the people we know, and all the staff who remember our order will come and celebrate with us. anyways. this place is nice. just dont go when its crowded.",

    "yea, they got rice mutha fcka, rice! so when the wu tang clan are in chicago, not only do they eat in the upstairs dining room of lao sze chuan, but after closing they kick it with the owner tony ( called fat tony, cause he's really skinny) hu at his favorite disco in schaumburg. yes you know you're in when you get the invite join fat tony at a disco in schaumburg as i have. i've not been yet, but i'm sure that it's the only cool joint in schaumburg. any way, back to my review. one of the reasons why chicago is such a provincial back water of a major city is because unlike new york, san fran, or nola, before my man tony hu arrived on this desolate scene, you couldn't even get real chinese here. yes chicago, egg foo young and chop suey are not chinese mutha fckas! what my man, fat tony be cook'n up is the really real. i'm talking szechwan soul food! how do you know it's real? well first by the heaps of fresh spicy heat used. yes bland midwest taste buds gooooo else ware! second, real chinese people are in there, straight grubbing down on duck bone soup, beef tendon with sour pickle, twice cooked spicy pork intestine, pig ear szechuan style, stir fried beef maw, house special dry chili duck tongue, sea cucumber or jelly fish home style. o.k. i'm not that adventurous, but my point is, this food is the real deal. personally, my favorite is the famous dungeoness empire lobster with fresh red chili, garlic and ground pork. i get this every time, yo! yea this place is the really real, all the way down to the maitre d who looks like he's from central casting of major villains from bruce lee movies. but instead of gold, he rocks jade bracelets and pinky ring, a diamond ear ring, gazelles, and a cool vest that might even be bullet proof! but warning yuppie and older hipster americans, don't bring your brats here! chinese children are super well behaved. but pale faced brats running around restaurants are not considered cute, but in fact are an insult to the house of lao sze chuan and an offense to the shaolin temple and bobbie digital. also the staff will laugh at you if you order shrimp fried rice. and no they don't speak english like the americanized chines places, but if you get huffy they will ask if you speak mandarin. and when you say no, they will tell you to shut the hell up because they speak mandarin, wu, cantonese,yue, min and english!",

    "i'm not sure what to give, this used to be my favorite place to go when i lived the neighboring state. and i'd still visit now and then because of the authentic sichuan spicy taste. but maybe 'chef. tony' has gotten too famous and the dishes has become bigger or the food is less. there's always a line outside, thanks to 'chef tony' and like many restaurants in china town, the wait staffs are over worked so not much service if you look and speaks chinese. unless the rest of your party isn't or maybe you know one of the owners. you've probably read about why people like this place. so i'll just tell you why i stop going there, just two reasons. first off since my parent live in indiana, they would always order something to go after having dinner there. and we've noticed a few times that they had made mistake on our bills. then they'd forgot something on our to go orders since the to go comes after the left overs there are too many boxes to count, silly us to believe. and one time when i take my friend out, i found hairs, jet black short hairs there. i asked the waiter and he joked about it with the other staff there. so i asked for refund and they insist on a free 'replacement' but still pay for half of it. did i mentioned that i had originally ordered it to go but they made a mistake and it's on a bowl, which i thank them for letting me see my food before i take home. i didn't end up in a hospital or anything but that was the last time i went. i paid the bill and left them my 'replacement' meal as tips because i know how 'good' the 'replacement taste.",

    "went here with a fellow yelper who loves this place. i trust his taste so i knew it would be good. we arrived at prime lunch hour and was told there would be a 10 minute wait for a table. not being in a hurry, we happily waited and enjoyed the near balmy temperatures outside and caught up. we could smell the delicious aromas emanating from inside and couldn't wait to eat. the adorable hostess dressed in traditional chinese garb soon came and showed us to our table. we looked over the huge menu and it was overwhelming. i deferred to my dc to make suggestions, but i had a couple of my own as well. we opted for the crispy salt and pepper lamb, potstickers, and chinese broccoli with garlic. the potstickers were fantastic. just enough filling and the wrapper itself wasn't glue y like you'd find at lower quality establishments. the salt and pepper lamb was perfectly crispy and quite flavorful. it was unlike anything i've ever had in a chinese restaurant before. my favorite dish though, was the chinese broccoli. if you've never had this underrated vegetable before, i urge you to give it a try. it has a marvelously mild bitter flavor, almost like a cross between broccoli and asparagus. i could have eaten that whole dish by myself, but then that wouldn't have been very gracious of me. service is perfunctory; that is, not friendly, but also not surly. just efficient and no nonsense, which is all you expect from a bustling restaurant at lunch time. can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",

    "what does a girl do when she has a day off and is already haunting cermak ave due to the location of her printer? she hits up lao sze chuan for some chef tony dry chili chicken, that's what! friendly and welcoming to the solo diner, the kind servers set me up with some hot and sour soup, a little plate of hot n' spicy house made cabbage gratis and my order of tony chicken. oh and the tea, a hot, steamy pot of delicious either oolong or jasmine tea, i couldn't tell and luckily i love them both. it doesn't come cheaply, these trips for tony chicken, but it's worth every red cent. and red pepper flake. got a head cold? go order what i just did and your passages will clear right up.",

    "it was a long day in the city and as the snow got heavier and the two got more wet, the couple headed down cermak towards lao sze chuan because of a reccomendation. they were hungry. the anticipation of good chinese food was exciting. they walk into a suprisingly crowded restaurant and told the hostess there will be two tonight. the hostess looks around the room carefully and then back at the couple. she scribbles something on a white square sheet of paper. ok. you take this upstairs and give it to the man. they are waiting for you up there. she says. feeling like they had walked onto a strange movie set, they headed back out the door and proceeded up the steps to the same restaurant. the square sheet of paper was handed over and the two were seated. they were handed a vast menu. it was hard to make a decision but they were forced to make one fast. it will be: sweet and sour soup, peking style noodles, orange beef,and mixed veggies. before the feast began they were tempted with a delighful cabbage treat delicately covered with a spicy sauce. before they could finish their soup the noodles came. there was no description of the noodles on the menu but they were feeling adventurous. to their delight, they were tasty yet some f the ingredients remained a mystery. was it tofu? was it mushrooms? it didnt matter, just bring on the rest of the food. out came the orange beef. the crispy coated beef melted with the citrus and the couple exclaimed mmmmmm! in unison. the crisp chinese veggies were a wonderful compliment to the entrees. more and more people poured into the place. big groups of folks; all kinds. the two observed what looked to be chinese fondue. oh how delightful! and a little disappointed that they had already eaten. the passing waiter was summoned and explained that it was called a hotpot. the fresh meat and veggies were cooked in one big pot placed on the table. ooooooh, this will surely get the couple back to lao sze chuan!",

    "i love going to chinese restaurants with my chinese friends! i learn so much about the different regional food. anyway, sze chuan style food is all about spicy! and so we had a lot of the traditional sze chuan style dishes such as dan dan mein, mapo tofu, and this beef in chili sauce dish. the dan dan mein were these noodles in chili sauce with pickled vegetables (appetizer) and was surprisingly tasty. the beef in chili sauce was very tender but there was so much cabbage vs. meat. i think next time i would only order one of these spicy type dishes b/c they were too similar. we also had some dumplings and shrimp and broccoli which were tasty but average. i think this place is all about what you order, so i'm sure i can change my rating next time around. it's so crowded and a very popular place when we went for friday lunch. yummy option in chinatown.",

    "i had such high expectations for this place. it was rated ninth best chinese restaurant in the country. this country? so i got a some friends to go after the auto show. i tried to make reservations but they didn't take them for less than six. no problem, they told me that it would be about a 10 minute wait at that time. it was 20 degrees out and windy. we were told that it would be a 20 minute wait. outside! again no problem. we had lucky number 13 after all. the first problem started when a group went in to put their name on the list. as they came out i saw that they had number 15. the guy at the desk immediately came out and said that is was to cold for them to stand outside and they would be seated right away. everone that had been standing outside had some choice words. i couldn't say anything as i was the one who dragged everyone here. when it was finally our turn they made us go upstairs. from the outside? when we got there we had to wait for our table to be ready. they were kind of small and we are big eaters. i asked if we could be seated at a table for 6 so we could get the hot pot. no! you sit at table for 4. there were 5 tables for 8 that were empty until we were about to leave. they put two groups of 4 at 2 of them and the rest sat empty. so that changed our menu plans. i asked for a soda right away. it never came. i asked for another pot of the luke warm tea. after the second time i asked, they brought it at the same time that we got the bill. the spicy cabbage could have been used as a salt lick. the crab rangoons were very dry. the pot stickers had a good taste and were very plump. the hot and sour soup was also good. they brought us the steamed rice and spicy pan fried pork. which was spicy and full of flavor. about 5 minutes later they brought the chaun beef. you get the picture. it took about 15 minutes for everyone to get their food. the orange tenderloin was very tasty. the crispy egg plant was so soggy and full of garlic that nobody ate it. the meat in it tasted and looked like tofu? where did the crispy come in? the pork was very smokey and that's about all you tasted. well, that and grease. the portitions were quite small for the price. the service was horrible. every one of the servers seemed to be in a bad mood. when ever the waiters walked by me they knocked into me. it became a joke at the table. there is a whole side of the restaurant that isn't being used. walk on that side. they have all those stickers on the door from zagots to yelp. did they stop trying? and what's with the plastic chop sticks? even the crappiest chinese restaurants have wood. it gives me the sence of cleanliness. when i went to wash my hands. the water was freezing cold from the automatic faucet. if you have no hot water in the washroom. then what about the kitchen? from now on i will stop listening to other peoples reviews. it's the original three happiness for me.",

    "this place is stellar for a spicy meal in the dead of winter. brought a couple of bells winter white ale, probably the best seasonal beer to go with spicy food. it is byob but they will charge you 10 bucks for corkage. the service was way better than the last time we were here, about a year or so ago. we usually get the hotpot but this time we wanted to revisit the classic szechuan dishes on the menu. we got the ma po tofu (must have) dry chili chicken and tong cai, my favorite asian green, which was stirfried with garlic. the ma po tofu is easily the best version of this dish in all of chicago, it's fiery red, not at all like the bland brown looking dish that you would get at other chinese restaurants that don't specialize in szechuan cuisine (and better than double li's the other szechuan place nearby). the dry chili chicken was a great contrast to the saucy and silky smooth ma po tofu. the chicken was crispy, full of spice and included nice big pieces of garlic, ginger and green onion. the tong cai served as a respite from the heat of the other two dishes and was perfectly crisp. the more we ate the spicier dishes, the more accustomed we got to the heat and we slowly began tasting the full spectrum of the flavors in the two preparations. but please let us be clear these dishes are for those who can handle the spice. needless to say, the beers served their function admirably, although if you don't bring your own, tsingtao draft will do the job just as well. it was a feast that i hope to repeat on any future winter night. without the corkage fee the total was about 40 bucks. not bad at all.",

    "yes, i really love the food here. it has the best mapo tofu in town let alone compare to many other chinese restaurants in other cities. i really think chicago has some really amazing chinese restaurants. they also have a really good vegetarian dish called tong cai (it's a vegetable that they sauteed in garlic) that i always order when i am there. the food comes out right away and is always hot! their hot and sour soup is really amazing too. my husband enjoys the wonton soup a lot. we also really enjoy the beef with green pepper (it's not spicy unless you ask for it). the only thing that i don't really like about this restaurant is that it can get really busy and you would have to wait for a table especially when you get their around 830 900 pm. be prepare to wait but the food is worth it.",

    "the food here is good, really good. but we had the worst experience i think i've ever had in chinatown last weekend. we made a reservation for 6 of us for 6 pm. not a problem, table was saved. but when the hostess sat us, the waiters talked about how we took the table without checking in, right in front of us in chinese.i speak chinese. when the waiter came, he quickly brought glassware for our wine and he opened it for us. nice. we ordered pot stickers to start. when i bit into it, it was dark dark pink and mushy. normally i wouldn't have a problem with the pinkness (pork cooks that way sometimes) but it looked and tasted raw in my mouth. i asked if he would send it back and recook it more. he comes back and says that's the way they serve them there. we all kind of sat there dumbfounded until i said, ok, if you think they're safe, we'll keep them. when all of a sudden he throws his arms up and walks away. so now i don't know if we're getting them or not because he never came back. ever. the entire evening. i really didn't think i was rude or anything and our table was in disbelief. fine. we move on to entrees. we flagged someone down to order. my husband ordered salt and pepper ribs. she repeated salt and pepper pork (same thing). we get our food and they bring us salt and pepper prawns. when we tell them, they apologize and bring us the pork. all the food was good and authentic. but we never got service again. for the next two hours we had to hail down a server for water, to pay the bill, ask for more rice. no one checked on us once. we thought that they would want to shoo us out on a busy saturday night but they never served us at all. we as a group dine out quite a bit and i like to think that we are a pretty easy going crowd. we all try new things, we ask for things nicely.so i really don't get what happened here. when we get the bill both salt and pepper items are on there along with the pot stickers. we only asked to have the pot stickers taken off since i only ate one bite. all in all it was such a disappointing experience because our friends had asked us to take them there hearing all the good press. we aren't ever going back again.",

    "4 stars for chinese food in chicago, 3 stars for chinese food overall. having been raised on chinese food, i guess i can vouch for the authenticity of it. but again, having been raised on chinese food, i can't give it more stars. lao sze chuan is a great place to get real chinese food none of that panda express nonsense but alas, the portions are on the petite side and the prices, definitely inflated. don't get me wrong, the food tastes good. my complaint really, is for the prices. that and perhaps the lack of intense spice that a true sze chuan menu should carry. but since i really don't have many other options in the area, i do frequent this restaurant and suggest the hot pot, dumplings, or if you're going for adventurous: spicy pot of pork blood and intestine. follow the crowd and follow your nose. lao sze chuan is the place to be in chicago's chinatown.",

    "my prior impression of lao sichuan had been good food, but horrible service. that was why i had not returned to the restaurant for over a year. my most recent visit, however, was a refreshing experience. i went with a friend from china who was in need of some authentic sichuan cuisine. the food was good as usual slightly watered down, but still authentic tasting sichuan dishes. more importantly, the service has markedly improved. our waitress was brisk but efficient and friendly. all wishes were granted without attitude. i still wouldn't use good to describe the service. but service is much better than before, and is definitely above the chinatown average. so if you have been deterred from going back because of its service, i'd say give it another shot. you might just be as pleasantly surprised as i was.",

    "lao is either significantly different than the last time i came here, or else my memory ain't what it used to be. i thought it was supposed to be rather spicy cuisine.? (hence the word szechuan: a style of chinese cuisine originating in sichuan province of southwestern china famed for bold flavors, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use of garlic and chili peppers, as well as the unique flavour of the sichuan peppercorn?) so where was my spice dammit. the dry chili rabbit i ordered looked amazing crisp pieces of meat mixed in with giant, lovely red chilies heck i even requested extra spicy! but nothing.not even a single tear formed! ugh. that plus the rabbit was very displeasingly full of tiny bones, which made eating difficult and i am sure unpleasant for my dining companions to have to watch me spit out all over the plate. potstickers were lovely and full of flavour, which i appreciated because i really got tired of picking through all the bones after awhile. oh well, let the search continue for spicy food.",

    "went for the first time with a group of 8. the meal was just over 11 dollars per person with two appetizers, two veggie dishes and duck, spicy beef, crispy chicken, tea and rice. it was amazing and we all walked away with spicy mouths and full bellies. the smoked tea duck is something else. my boyfriend and i enjoy, nay, love bejing duck and this was a special surprise. the spicy sze chuan beef was indeed, incredibly spicy but so tender and flavorful. i'll be going back for dim sum which my bf says is worth it. also, does anyone know how to make the spicy shredded cabbage appitizer? its amazing and i'm looking to replicate it they lost a star for the service. the staff and servers were not friendly, nor helpful and didn't seem to care whether we were having a good time or not. plus they let some strange guy take photos of us from outside the restaurant.",

    "wow, lao, i like your style! your food is bangin'. the twenty minute wait, not so much. i'm not saying a wait is not to be expected at a delicious restaurant, but there is nowhere to sit so you have to stand there smashed up against some other starving waitee and have nothing to do but stare at everyone's food. but, i digress. on to the food. i had been craving hot and sour soup all day, and was delighted when i ordered a cup and it didn't have ufo's (unidentified floating objects) like many a hands soups i've experienced before. this hot and sour was straight to the point hot, sour and tofu/mushroom laden. and vegetarian to boot! much like the chips and salsa placed on the table at a mexican restaurant, lao sze chuan's version of this is the spicy cabbage dish served once you've been seated. slightly vinegar y, this chili oil dressed slaw with flecks of chili pepper sucked the sinus issues right out of me! for an appetizer, my roomie and i ordered the green beans in black bean sauce. chopped green beans with a hint of soy sauce and fermented black beans absolutely delicious, and not over powering and filling (ahem.eggroll). my only complaint is the apparent carpel tunnel syndrome i developed from picking up tiny beans one at a time with chopsticks. oh, i'm just complaining because i didn't want to be the only person using a fork in the entire restaurant. anyway. for the main event, we decided to get two different entrees and split them after much debate about getting the hotpot (which we will most certainly explore next time). so, we went with the staple orange chicken crispy and flavorful, and they even asked if we wanted it spicy! yeah! also, the sze chuan beef, which was good but the beef was a little soft and strangely textured. the sauce was spicy and flavorful though, and the veggies crunchy and fresh. i think i might just go with vegetarian options next time. to all the vegetarians out there check this place out. there are tons of veggie options! overall.a very satisfying experience. i can't wait to get back there and try some other dishes (all 900 of them).",

    "a must try! one of the first restaurant that serves all around authentic szechuan cuisine in chicago! for those with a palate for spicy food i can't even remember when i started coming here. i order the same two dishes every time. red chili pepper drenched fish fillet and baby pea pod leaves. they really do have less intimidating names on the menu but i'm embarrassed to say i still don't know what the dishes are called or even how to pronounce them. i speak chinese and must have had the same order 20 times. the baby peapod goes really well with the chili pepper sauce. if you're feeling the taste of the cuisine, also try the chili beef appetizer (cold dish again i know my description is lacking but the waiters are helpful). just be aware if you're allergic to peanuts or have a distaste for cilantro. they are key garnishes on the dish. the restaurant also serves hot pot there. for those who are not familiar with it, i'll equate it to chinese fondue (like you get at melting pot) or shabu shabu if you've tried on the west coast. you cook all kinds of seafood, veggies, meat in a broth of two selection. the chili one is my preference but of course there's a herbal broth for people who can't take the spice. you pay anywhere from 16 to 24/pp for all you can eat depending if you go on a weekday or weekend. the experience is fun and definitely more intimate. there are a few places in chinatown that serves hotpot and lao sze chuan is decently good. try it in the winter, nothing's like cooking your food over a steaming pot of delish broth to warm you up. i want to say that the rest. is byob but i've never brought my own bottle there before and they do have a wine bar upstairs. it'll be good to check beforehand.",

    "my father looooooooooves chinese food, but not just any kind of chinese food for example you can't get him into a chinese restaurant in miami to save your life. he does love sze chuan food. loves the spiciness of it and you know what? so do i. while i lived in chicago i looked forward to my dad visiting me every time. not only b/c i got to see him, but b/c i knew that on the way home from the airport before doing anything else, we were going to stop at lao sze chuan for a huge family dinner. this restaurant is always packed, which says a lot. it's just off the chinatown strip, but with huge lettering on their awning it's hard to miss. i still remember the first time my husband and i drove past it. we immediately made a note to remember and bring my dad here. we were definitely not disappointed. the food portions were plentiful and had just the right spice, and the prices moderate; the service (was okay that's where they loose a star). i do have to admit, since moving back to miami i miss it! the cantonese place down the corner from my house now doesn't even come close. oh well, it will have to do for now. but i think that like my father, next time i head to chicago this may just be my first stop straight from the airport mmm mmm good!",

    "ok, this place seems to be the place to go with the kids in the know when in chinatown. to be honest , it probably did produce the best food i've eaten in the neighborhood. the downside, it was crowded as hell and the service was crappy. the server delivered one of our 3 entrees 15 minutes before the others were ready, and forgot to bring a side of spring rolls we ordered. the food, on the flip side was very good, i especially loved the selection. it was probably the biggest chinese menu i've seen in my entire life. it was chock full of obscure goodness like frog dishes and clam dishes. we started with potstickers, which were perfect as far as i'm concerned. the crab rangoon was very good, but i haven't really had standout crab rangoon in years. my date ordered the seafood combo lo mein , i thought it was a solid good. i've had way better chinese seafood, but it did the job. the beef fried rice was very good, standard but very good. the real star of the show , as far as i'm concerned was the salt and pepper lamb. if your neighborhood chinese places carried this dish, it might make it into my rotation of dishes i always order, it was great! so to sum up, if you aren't a service snob, the food here was pretty damn good, just make sure you keep bugging that server for what you ordered.",

    "normally for chinese new years, a group of us will travel down to chinatown for our yearly ritual. the last couple of years, we've leaned towards family styles meals rather than dim sum. i'm so glad last year we went to lao sze chuan! there were 9 of us in the group and since it was chinese new years, we made reservations. i'm so glad we did because it was a very popular place! it was super packed and every table was filled. this restaurant is 2 levels with most of the big tables on the 2nd floor. we did a traditional family style meals ordering between 10 13 entrees raging from sauteed veggies, beef, chicken, pork, and seafood. the menu is quite extensive, so either ask for recommendation or bring someone familiar with the menu with you. i really don't remember one bad dish. i thought everything was very tasty. i also went there another time to have hot pot. they have an all you can eat hot pot where you can order as much as you like off their set menu. my friend that came with me has celiac disease and they were very accommodating in making sure whatever we ordered she could eat. the service is what you can expect in another other restaurant in chinatown. when they are busy, it isn't very fast. but overall, their food is solid and reliable. you know that every time you go, the food will be good.",

    "my favorite place for authentic spicy szechuan cuisine. go there on a weeknight or better yet for lunch. they have a lunch menu with smaller size versions of many popular dishes (not much smaller). you have to ask for the lunch menu because they don't give it to you willingly (kind of annoying actually but now you know it exists). monday through friday is when the lunch menu is served. prices are cheap and each dish comes with your choice of hot and sour soup or egg drop soup (i always get hot and sour) and an egg roll, but they charge 1 for a bowl of rice, but even then its still cheap. another tip, is sometimes if you pay cash, they'll give you a 5% discount off your bill, but you have to ask but it may not always be the case. my favorite dishes, in no particular order, are: 1. dry chili chicken (for a slightly sweet version order tony's dry chili chicken); 2. dan dan noodles; 3. szechuan string beans; 4. pork with wood ears; 5. potherb 6. salt and pepper fish; 7. potstickers (really excellent); 8. tri color bean curd there are a lot of delicious veggie and fish options. as far as ma po tofu is concerned, it is very authentic here, but a bit greasy for me (its the large pool of red chili oil floating on the top), but its is very tasty. i just don't always order it because it can be kind of painful to eat.",

    "4 star rating. based on 186 reviews. umm. really?!?! personally, i find my 2 stars quite generous giving the quality of the dishes that lao sze chuan shells out. to start, two different servers delivered two pestering attempts to sell their impressive list of beers and wines. declining politely both times, they continued on to advertise their real fruit smoothies. admittedly, that sounded great on the humid day that we swung by; disappointingly enough, lychee was not an option so i settled with the pineapple smoothie instead. onto the food. having read many reviews about the tony's chicken with three chili, it behooves me to order the dish. yes, the spices blended well, but imagine my surprise when i found that most of the chicken chunks were actually breaded chunks of batter. the salt and pepper fried smelt was equally uninspiring. typically, smelt are fried to a crispy perfection i.e. crispy enough that one would not have to wind up in the emergency room having choked on the bone and all. lsc's version? great blend of flavors once again, but have 911 on speed dial if you wish to conquer the dish. lastly, the szechuan beef. surprisingly the only okay dish of the night, but the slices of beef were oddly soft and moist. do yourself a favor and check out the other (better!) dining options in chinatown square instead.",

    "we went too this restaurant tonight and i had the most embarrasing time of my life. i have never reviewed a resturant. i have had some bad meals and some good meals. i cannot say that my problem was with the meal or for that matter with the particular young man that helped us. but with the establishment as a whole and the philosophy of the place. our bill for two came out to 76+. kind of hefty for a mid week chinese meal. but then again this is not a problem either. ok so here is the problem. we ordered some appetizers and then we ordered the main dish the hot pot. they brought the food to the table and we thought that at 16.95 per person the food they brought us belonged to us. but no only the food you eat is yours. yes the fine print on the menu says that you cannot take away the hot pot left overs, didn't see that. but then again who would expect that if you bring food to the table you are going to take it back. so why, well there could only be one good reason, because they bring you the food and if you don't eat it they serve it to someone else. highly illegal and quite unsanitary, i might add. why else would they tell us that we could not take home the food that was on our plate. we ended up getting into an argument in the middle of the dining room. i have never had that happened before and i have dined all over the world. so tomorrow i plan to file a complaint with the health department. these people are reserving food. plain and simple, no other reason why they will not let people take food home that is already on the table. so worst restaurant experience of my life. oh, i forgot to mention the waiter that came yelling at us and almost dropped his false teeth from his mouth.",

    "take note, yelpers: 5 stars rating on a chinese restaurant, from a very critical chinese diner. yes, it's that freakin good! okay, i am a chinese food snob. i lived in shanghai for a year, and fell in love with sze chuan cuisine, particularly the ma la (translated as numbing spicy) spice. most chinese restaurants in the us will have some form of sze chuan chicken on their menu, but, lacking the ma la spice, it's usually a pretty embarrassing representation of sze chuan cuisine. and that's why i loved lao sze chuan this is authentic sze chuan cuisine. finally! i don't care for the trendy fusion asian crap, or the gloppy, syrupy americanized chinese food (orange chicken? gross). give me real chinese food, something that people in china would actually want to eat. lao sze chuan? bingo. we ordered the eggplant with pork (owner tony's recommendation), the garlic dou miao (eek, fob moment don't know what this vegetable is called in english), and the lalala (ie, spicyspicyspicy) chicken. tony, who happened to be good friends with my fellow diner, also brought us a beautiful five plate sampling of spicy cold appetizers i hadn't had these since i left shanghai three years ago, and man, it brought me right back. the food? amazing. tony? incredible entrepreneur, with such charisma. congrats, tony. i think i found my favorite chinese restaurant in chicago!",

    "this is a great introduction to chinese food and to chinatown. i understand that it's kind of an icon here, and i can see why. the menu is absolutely, intensely huge thank goodness i had suz c and chan (again) to help place our order, or we would have been there all night waiting for me to decide what to try. we had tony's chicken, baby pea pods, crab rangoon, spicy cabbage, a spicy lamb dish, and a dish of green beans cooked with chiles and other spices. oh, and a duck dish. have i mentioned yet that we got all this food for 22 a piece including tip (4 people)? wow. ok, the food is absolutely, intensely good. best ever? perhaps not, but damn, it's up there. the only disappointment, deb and i agreed, was the crab rangoon. the duck was fair but not particularly spectacular either. the lamb dish we had was quite good, nice and spicy that warmed up your mouth but didn't make you cry. thank goodness, because i forgot to wear waterproof mascara . . . ha ha clean, good feeling about the place. and it's busy. serv ice was good. another note: go early if you want to spend the evening checking out the shops and other things in the area most places in chinatown close at 8 or 9pm, even on saturdays. overall, a good experience. i would definitely eat here again.",

    "i've been three times now to lao sze chuan, and each visit has been a bit of a culinary adventure. my only complaint is that the menu is so sprawling and sometimes vague or clumsily translated into english that it's hard for someone who isn't in the know about traditional chinese dishes to make decisions. i prefer to visit with a large group in order to try a bit of everything. better yet if i can visit with chinese friends who can really steer me in the right direction. i'm a very adventurous eater, and it's nice to be able to process all the details of a menu before making final decisions. all that said, everything i've had has been terrific. the famous three chili chicken is as good as its reputation. pig stomach in garlic sauce was spicy, garlicky and a welcome addition to my culinary repertoire. i even love the little cabbage in chili oil amuse bouche presented on the table before the rest of the meal is served. my preference is to order a variety of dishes (meats, vegetables, seafood) in varying degrees of spiciness. this being a sze chuan restaurant, spicy is usually the order of the day, but there are variations to be found in noodle and dumpling dishes to help cool down from some of their more intense creations. one word of warning: this place gets crowded very quickly, and one should expect a wait for a table during peak hours. the staff aren't the most helpful people in the world (not rude, but not inclined to engage in friendly banter either). if you are at a table during peak times, you may have that feeling that you're getting the eye from someone who is anxious to clear your place and give it to the next person in line. it may not be the most traditional chinese restaurant for some who know better, but it's a quantum leap ahead of the completely americanized chinese restaurants that serve up gelatinous servings of sweet and sour pork.",

    "you know what.im not asian.by any means.but what i do know is this place to me at least was pretty authentic.i say this because the place was packed and my buddy and i were some of the only white boys in there. rocked out the szechuan chicken.ha.why not.it was a yelp recommendation.and it was hot.maybe because they poured the chili pepper bottle into the sauce.good stuff though.the chicken fell apart while i ate it.my buddy had the duck.and i think he was a fan of it.the wonton soup was pretty awesome and his hot and sour was really good too.they made home made sweet and sour and spicy mustard sauces for the crab rangoon and egg rolls also. good stuff big fan.if you feel like being an asian for a day.this spot up right off the chinatown red line.then go get some desserts down the street from the asian bakeries.you cant find that stuff anywhere else in the city",

    "oy, i thought for sure this would be a winner. a solid four star restaurant with numerous amply worded reviews. yelp has never steered me wrong, but there's a first for everything. meh. i've experienced better. perfect summation. my experimental taste buds are happy to indulge in sea cucumber and frog legs. . . if your kung pao and mushu blow me away. and these didn't. in fact, it was all mediocre to completely dissatisfying. admittedly, my coy friend ordered chicken curry (for which he soon repented) and it was quite bad, but not the place. not the time. the chinese broccoli with garlic was good enough i would eat it as a meal in and of itself. fiber tastic. but the pot stickers, la la la chicken and pork mushu were bland, and suspicious. i know lsc is legit because it has legions of fans, but i'm a touch burned by my first chinatown experience. sad face. not to mention the service. i was impressed that our waiter could identify the numbers i scribbled on our paper table cloth (making life easier for people wherever i go) by name. . . that's some fancy decoding, power ranger san. but he dropped our food off and went out to smoke a pack, i think. we waited, and waited and waited. not just to leave, but to be seated. so, fooey. i'd go to lsc again, but only after i try every other restaurant in c town. and that's going to take a hot minute or two.",

    "probably the most popular and well known restaurant in chicago chinatown. i have asian friends living in cities all over the us and it seems like they have all heard of this place or been here. you may have a wait a bit to get your table, but the wait is usually under 15 minutes and if you want sichuan cuisine, this is the place to go! dishes to order: sichuan cuisine is known for spiciness so you have been warned. my favorite dishes here are the water boiled beef and the mapo tofu. the water boiled beef comes in a fiery red chili sauce and contains chinese cabbage. a great sauce to eat with some rice. the mapo tofu here comes red and fiery as well. the other dish my dining companions always get is the chili chicken. lightly battered and flash fried chicken that is stir fried with fiery whole dried chilis. not my thing, but if you like chicken and spicy, try it out. the other thing to try lao sze chuan out for is their hot pot. for under 20 per head you can get all you can eat hot pot. veggies, meat, and seafood. this may get a bit messy, but it is definitely worth trying out hot pot here if you haven't before. other places you can go if spicy isn't your thing: i think lao sze chuan is a little dirtier than the other lao restaurants. still cleaner than a normal chinatown restaurant. if you don't like spicy, try out one of tony gourmet group's other restaurants, lao shanghai or lao beijing.",

    "this is a fantastic authentic sichuan restaurant. we used to dine here weekly, especially in the winter time. there's nothing like real sichuan cuisine on a cold wintery day. if you're plan to dine here, order the real sichuan dishes and avoid the few pseudo items they have on the menu to appease those not familiar with real sichuan cuisine. some items that are outstanding here are: boiled beef: slices of beef in a red spicy stew with chines cabbage on the bottom. the dish is really garlicky and spicy. the way sichuan should be. cumin lamb: slices of lamb stir fried with cumin, fennel, chili peppers, garlic, ginger, soy, bell peppers and onions. this is a nice and flavorful dish with strong northwestern chinese flavors. spicy dry beef: shredded beef fried and then stir fried with shredded celery, carrots, chili peppers, ginger and garlic. the texture is slightly crisp and flavor is nice. spicy pork with chinese celery: shredded pork that is really tender stir fried with chinese celery (stronger in flavor and smaller stalk than celery), chili peppers, garlic, ginger. this is a great spicy pork dish. =yu shiang (xiang) pork shredded pork with tree ears (mushrooms), water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, onions, garlic and chili. this is a famous sichuan dish. double dry chili pork or beef or shrimp three color home style appetizer three shredded vegetables in hot oil and garlic. i think it's carrots, dried tofu and i forgot the third vegetable used there. tender (fatty) pork with garlic appetizer: pork belly boiled and sliced thinly marinated with loads of garlic, some chili peppers, soy paste, sugar and a hint of ginger. pork belly is very fatty but tasty. this is served cold. there are some items on the menu that are not authentic designed to cater to the non chinese. so, if you order the standard americanized chinese items eggrolls (not sichuan), sweet and sour (not sichuan), egg drop soup (not sichuan), mongolian beef, pot sticker (not sichuan), mushu pork (not sichuan) you will detect no significant difference from what you normally have in other chinese restaurants. in fact, they may not be as good as other chinese restaurants. why? since people already have very strong ideas of what these items should look and taste (they're practically american dishes), most chinese restaurants just serve those dishes like what the non chinese expect them to taste. sure, those items exist in china, but they rarely made available in the authentic form since chinese rarely order those item. so, don't order those items! try real sichuan food and then decide if it's for you or not.",

    "i'm torn between giving this a 3 or 4 star rating, i feel like i can't give this place a fair shake since i haven't tried enough of the food on their menu but since this was my first time dining at this establishment i'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. i went stag, arriving at half past six on a wednesday, the place was pretty crowded but they were able to squeeze me into one of their smaller tables after just a few minutes. like many chinese restaurants, i was absolutely flabbergasted by the amount of choices on the menu! i decided to play it safe since i tend to have bad experiences at chinese restaurants when trying to be adventurous, so i ordered the mongolian beef tenderloin. i tried asking my waitress for advice on ordering an appetizer but she had difficulty understanding me. i think i was finally able to get my point across by using hand / pointing gestures to which she responded, pot stickers or crab rangoon. i'm not crazy about either but i took her advice and ordered the crab rangoon. while i waited i sipped on their hot tea and munched on their spicy cabbage appetizer (both complimentary). the hot tea didn't seem noticeably different from the tea i've had at countless other places but not bad. i really enjoyed the spicy cabbage though, it was just the right crispness and the sauce really gave it a good flavor. the crab rangoon and the mongolian beef arrived at the same time but the rice was not yet ready so they served me yet another plate of spicy cabbage. the crab rangoon seemed to have a more generous share of meat but as far as taste i could tell little difference from other restaurants, next time i'll try the pot stickers. the mongolian beef was quite good. i thought the sauce had a flavor very similar to the plum sauce that is typically served with duck in chinese cuisine, but it wasn't as strong and didn't have a strange after taste that i had been accustomed to. after having eaten 4 crab rangoons and two plates of spicy cabbage i was feeling a bit full so i took a significant share of it home. overall the service was quite good given how busy the place was, i think my only complaint would be that it took a few passes before one of the waitresses asked if i had been waited on. i will definitely be coming back here to try other dishes on their extensive menu.",

    "tried this place for the first time today and was really happy with the whole experience. before we even ordered, my friend spilled his water everywhere and the staff rushed over and were really nice and cleaned it up right away. the three of us ordered the vegetarian chicken appetizer, which was very interesting.i didn't really like it, but it was something different. definitely not like you'd find at chicago diner or in the morningstar freezer. for the entree, the three of us ordered three different dishes and shared them all, which was a great way to do it. we all agreed that the eggplant in garlic (i use quotes because it did not taste garlic y at all) sauce was the best. the sauce was kinda spicy sweet and the eggplant itself was fresh and tasty and well cooked.and i'm not a huge eggplant fan. the homestyle bean curd and sauteed potatoes were good as well. usually i end with a complaint but honestly i don't think i have one about this place. check it out!",

    "i went here with 5 other people for the hot pot buffet. we got a hot pot that was split with nonspicy broth and spicy broth. it comes with three different sauces to be mixed up as your dipping sauce (satay sauce, sesame, and garlic oil). then comes the raw foods shrimp, mussels, squid, lamb, beef, fish, fish balls, meat balls, watercress, romaine lettuce, and tofu. you basically want to wait till the broth boils, then start cooking to your heart's desire! everything was yummy, especially the beef, watercress, and seafood. after tax and tip it ended up being 24 pp. honestly, i probably could make it at home for a whole lot cheaper, but it was still fun and good nonetheless.",

    "i'm giving them two stars based only on recent visits. several years ago i would have given them 3, maybe even 4 stars, but quality or at least consistency has fallen quite a bit since then. expectations have also risen, as competition has stiffened not just from the two sister restaurants, but from other chinatown restaurants improving, too. most people may not know this, but lao szechuan is named the same as the most famous restaurant in chongqing, sichuan province. those are big shoes to fill, and it's unfortunate that chicago's lao szechuan doesn't come closer to filling them. first off, the hotpot here is just unacceptable. even on a good night, it's of poor quality and not reflective of how good hotpot can be. best hotpot in chinatown is at mandarin kitchen, across archer from lao szechuan. second, on a good night you can still get well made sichuan food here, but it's really become hit or miss. 50 50 is about right. finally, it's still worth taking the gamble if you want something on their expansive menu that you can't find anywhere else. i'm hopeful that as tony gets his restaurant empire under control quality will even out and improve across the board. until then, though, i'm sticking with my two star review.",

    "first time i ever went here was when i first moved here from cali. i was in love. i tried out the orange chicken. it wasn't too orange y or sweet, not too spicy. (back then i was a total wuss about spicy stuff.) the tea they serve complimented the chicken very well. i couldnt handly the cabbage stuff they serve before your meal. we went again when his sister was graduating college, with the boyfriends mama and sister. i still couldn't eat spicy stuff but this time was cause of my breastfeeding babes. i ended up returning my favorite dish orange chicken of course and waiting about 1/2 an hour while i hungrily watched everyone else recieve and finish their dinner. after patiently waiting, i recieved my dish, cold and still spicy. it was clear to me they had taken my dish, let it sit (was i being punished?!) and get cold. i was let down, dissapointed. but still in love with my orange chicken. i went again on christmas eve to reward myself for going out on such a dreary cold day during the busiest season of the year just to return a few items on public transportation, too. (poor me.) i don't mind going and having lunch alone once in a while, but wondered how i would be treated by the staff. i was pretty much ignored. two tables came in after me, and were both served before me. lunch came quickly, chicken fried rice, potstickers (delicious!) and wonton soup. yes, i was starving but my eyes were bigger than my stomach. it was too much for one person. fried rice: if you love bean sprouts, go for it. i have never eaten so many in my life, let alone one sitting. the chicken was flavorless. i think they used a can of peas and carrots or maybe the frozen stuff. i've made the stuff myself and consider mine flavorful, simple yet delicious. you can be sure i was highly dissapointed. potstickers: so good. they're sweet, full of flavor and great with the dipping sauce. wonton soup: simple, hot, satisfying. i've also gone for take out once and the boyfriend does not like his old favorite beef and broccoli anymore. the orange chicken was perfect that time but i was so let down to go out of my way to get dinner for us, only to have the boyfriend turn his nose. i couldn't enjoy my own dinner. i ordered potstickers that time too, which i ended up waiting way too long for! it was ridiculous, waiting 30 minutes longer than they said it would take. all in all, i will be going somewhere else. it seems every time i go, it gets worse and the staff is not very great in my opinion.",

    "authentic, but very spicy, chinese food. tony hu's place is one of the best chinese restaurants i've ever been to. the food is outstanding and worth the occasional wait. however, fair warning, sometimes the dishes are almost too spicy to be enjoyed. favorites are the green bean and black bean appetizer, homestyle tofu, hot and sour soup, and the dry spiced chicken. ma pao bean curd is essentially tofu cubes swimming in chili oil killer, but delicious. again, if you like leaving with tears in your eyes, go nuts. otherwise, ask for mild!",

    "if you're interested in chinese food in chicago, it's hard not to have heard all the praise for this place. with that in mind, i'd been looking for a chance to try this place for ages, and i'm happy to report that it met my expectations. for some reason most of the chinese restaurants i've happened upon in chicago have been cantonese style or super americanized light on the spice and with few interesting vegetarian options. lao sze chuan has pages of exciting sounding vegetable dishes; it has pages of just about every kind of dish, in fact. i decided to try the double fried eggplant with fresh chili, and my meat eating companion had the dry chili chicken. a word on the service: it's clearly well intentioned but very erratic. we were greeted by a smiling gentleman (the owner?) who silently held up two fingers in lieu of asking how many we were; later he assisted a table next to ours with very precise and plentiful instructions on how the hot pot should be prepared and eaten. our orders took a long time to appear, and mine came out long before my increasingly hungry and irritated companion's. water was refilled frequently, however, and it's a good thing, too my eggplant was extremely spicy, though the heat magically stopped right at the point where pleasure would have turned into pain. my companion found the spice one dimensional, but i had to disagree, tasting undertones of extra fresh ginger and garlic. the eggplant itself was shaved thin and perfectly soft, no sauce and not much grease simple and excellent. the dry chili chicken was a terrifying looking plate, bristling with more whole chilis than chicken, but my companion said that the spiciness was actually quite bearable. prices here are a little higher and portions a little smaller than most places in chinatown, but this is quality stuff. it'll take me many, many visits to work my way through the veggie section of their menu, but i intend to try.",

    "hot spicy food on a cold night. perfect combination! it was a spicy themed night out for us and lao sze chuan was perfect for this theme. they have a pretty huge extensive menu and a lot of the meals were noted as spicy. i did notice that they have options for mild, hot or super hot but most of the things we order were all between hot and super hot. we started with a couple of bowls of hot and sour soup and a bowl of egg drop soup and some pork potstickers. the hot and sour soup was spicy! it was a heartier soup than i expected and had great flavor and a tons of things in it (i couldn't tell you what was in it if i tried.) the potstickers were huge, way bigger than i am used to but they were a bit to much for me considering it was only meat inside. for entrees we decided to just stick to what we know this time around. we got kung pao chicken (super spicy), sze chuan beef (spicy) and moo shoo shrimp (not spicy and super refreshing.) they were all super yummy and the portions were huge. i have to say that my favorite was the moo shoo shrimp but i think it was partly the overload of spiciness on the other two dishes. the service was great. everyone was friendly and the food came out fast. the place is tiny but they let us enjoy our bottle wine and food coma long after the food was packed up. i would love to go back and try the hot pot it looked like so much fun. i would definitely recommend this spot!",

    "for anyone who gave this place less than four stars how? i rarely think anything is perfect, but this place is as good as it gets in terms of quality of food and bang for your buck. i went with four others, and between us, we ordered crab rangoon, hot and sour soup, pork dumplings, spicy dried beef, crack chicken, orange chicken and beef, garlic chicken. everything was delicious, minus the spicy dried beef, which was kind of just like beef jerky with a spicy sauce drizzled over it. i still found it decent though. the crack chicken, aka tony's 3 chili chicken, was my favorite. it doesn't look like it's coated in anything, but it is with a sort of sweet, smoky and spicy glaze. the orange dishes were superb and extremely flavorful, the soup was scrumtrulescent, and the rangoon was honest to god the best i've ever had. the only other qualm i have is that the hot pepper oil is extremely hot, and i wasn't really warned about it but i guess that's more my friends' fault because they knew prior to me ingesting it. and the price was very good as well. it's not extremely cheap, but it's about what you would expect dishes to cost in a sit down place, and they give you a lot of food. the service was kind of slow, but hey, they were extremely busy, and i'm willing to let that slide because the food was worth the wait. a definite must eat place if you are even a casual fan of chinese.",

    "great spicy food. if you don't like spicy food this is not your place. go friday or saturday night and get the hot pot. for 17.00 a piece you can cook your own food and have some fun. the dishes are great and filled with hot peppers, but you can ask that they be prepared without the hot peppers. unfortunately, they do not always get it right. as far as the food is concerned this place gets 5 stars. so if you want great spicy food and reasonable prices this is a winner. six people for less than 90.00 plus a 20 tip. but here is why i give it one star. service was as bad as it gets. we had to ask for everything over and over (water, napkins, etc.). we waited for everything. our table was never cleaned or even brushed off. we were ignored and they were not apologetic. they simply did not care. we came in late, but we were not the last people to come in. and the final insult was when we wanted desert and we were told the kitchen had closed down. never go her late in the evening or when they are packed. there are too many great restaurants in chinatown to waste your time on one that does not take service seriously. ok, so why did i leave a big tip? there were six of us and that is a lot of work even if the work was not done well. whenever i go to a restaurant and they force a tip i just leave the minimum. when the place respects the patrons i show respect back by doing the right thing. this place did not add the tip into the check and so i was respectful to the servers. the food was good enough to make me go back and when i do i will give it another review. a meal without good service is simply not fun and that is why we go out, to enjoy ourselves. restaurants must understand that. the experience is only good when both food and service are done well.",

    "51.52.53.54! i counted 54 chili peppers on my dish of dry chili chicken! my mouth is watering just thinking about how good this dish is. the chicken has a light crisp texture on the outside, is moist on the inside, and is bursting with chili flavor. my only complaint was that i wish the portion was bigger as i practically inhaled this dish. i also loved the dry chili string beans and the eggplant in garlic sauce. i requested that they go easy on the oil as eggplant is sometimes be deep fried before it's stir fried, and it came out perfect. i only wish i didn't have to go to chinatown to enjoy tony's food. tony, if you're reading.open up shop on the north side!",
