# EECS 6893: Final Project, Fall 2021 - Yelp Help!

The project consists of three parts.
- Scrapers (Scrapes data from Yelp.com) 
- NER model (Model training and inference to get menu items `Pseudo-menus`)
- Web app (Can be used by consumers to look at the generated menus by entering city and zipcode)

The scraped data is used to generate .

    Pseudo-menu: This is not the typical menu that we see in restaurants where they might have their own obscure names for common food items. For example "Eggs canâ€™t be cheese" this is a burger. So our Pseudo-menu will just have one menu item named "burger".


## Installation
To run the web server, open your terminal and clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sapphirine/202112-51-YelpHelp.git
```

Then, create a virtual environment

```shell
conda create --name myenv
```

Activate your environment and install required dependencies from requirements.txt

```shell
conda activate myenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installation, `cd` into `webapp/backend` then you can start the server and see the results from local host on port 7777

```shell
python yelp_help_api.py
```
